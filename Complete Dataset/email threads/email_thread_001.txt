Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special event. Our offerings include a variety of options, and we specialize in creating memorable culinary experiences.  

For a gala, we typically suggest a mixed menu that can include both meat and dairy options to accommodate a wide range of preferences. We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We typically cater for a minimum of 100 guests and can serve up to 300.  

If beverages are of interest, we can discuss a bar package separately. Please let me know if you have specific dietary accommodations in mind, and I would be happy to provide a sample menu that highlights our offerings.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your response and the details provided. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the information on kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to keep the costs a bit lower if possible. Would you consider a price of $65 per person?  

Also, could you clarify whether your quote includes a bar service, or would that be an additional cost? We expect around 150 guests, and I want to ensure we have enough food and drink for everyone.  

Thanks for your help!  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I understand your concerns regarding the budget. While our standard price is $75 per person, I can offer a special rate of $70 per person for 150 guests, including VAT.  

Regarding the bar service, it is not included in the initial quote but can be arranged for an additional $15 per person. We can also ensure that all dietary restrictions are accommodated, including gluten-free and vegetarian options. Please let me know if this works for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the details.  

Best,  
David
