Dear Rachel,  
Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights Catering regarding your upcoming corporate gala on October 15th. We specialize in creating exquisite dining experiences and would love to discuss how we can cater your event. Our pricing typically starts at £45 per person, which includes a selection of mixed hors d'oeuvres, a main course, and dessert. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

All of our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Manchester Beth Din, and we can offer a variety of options, including meat and dairy dishes. Additionally, we can provide a bar service for an extra fee. Our packages can also include beverage options, and we are happy to cater to dietary restrictions upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific menu preferences in mind.  

Best regards,  
David from Gourmet Delights Catering

Hello David,  
Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. However, our budget is a bit tighter than your initial pricing. Is there any flexibility on the £45 per person rate? We're expecting around 75 guests, and I want to ensure we stay within our budget while still offering a great experience.  

Also, could you clarify whether the £45 includes VAT, and if we can consider a bar option for an additional fee?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Rachel

Hi Rachel,  
I understand your concerns regarding the budget. I can offer a revised rate of £40 per person, which still includes a selection of meat and dairy dishes, and this price does indeed include VAT. For the bar service, we can provide a variety of options starting from £15 per guest, depending on the drinks package you prefer.  

Should we proceed, I can guarantee a minimum of 75 guests with a maximum of 120. We do require a cancellation notice of at least 14 days to avoid any charges. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal proposal.  

Best,  
David
