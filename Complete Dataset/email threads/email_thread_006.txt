Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the proposal. I appreciate the variety of options you mentioned. Given our budget constraints, could you let me know if there is any flexibility on the pricing? We are expecting around 70 guests, but we may be able to adjust our numbers.  

Also, can you confirm if the food is kosher and the supervision details? Some of our guests have specific dietary requirements, so any additional information on that front would be helpful.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. I can offer a reduced price of $40 per person if you commit to at least 70 guests. As for the kosher requirements, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. 

We can also provide a selection of pareve options for those who need them. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event date.  

Let me know if this arrangement works for you, and I’ll prepare a detailed menu for your review.  

Best regards,
