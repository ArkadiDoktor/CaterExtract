Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds perfect for our corporate gathering. I would like to confirm if the $50 per person includes beverages, or if that would be an additional cost. Also, could you provide details on the kosher supervision for the food?  

We are expecting around 100 guests, so I would appreciate any suggestions you have for popular dishes that are well received.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The pricing of $50 per person does not include beverages; we can offer a bar package as an additional service. As for kosher supervision, all our dishes are certified kosher by the Rabbinical Council of Greater Washington.  

For your event of around 100 guests, I recommend some of our popular choices, such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and assorted pastries for dessert. Remember, we can accommodate any additional dietary restrictions you may have.  

Please let me know if you would like to finalize the arrangements or if you have more questions.  

Warm regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at the agreed price of $50 per person, excluding beverages. Please prepare a menu that includes the herb-roasted chicken and grilled vegetable platters, along with gluten-free options for a few guests.  

I understand that the cancellation policy allows for changes up to a week before the event, which sounds reasonable. Please confirm this arrangement, and I’ll arrange for a deposit to secure the booking.  

Best,
