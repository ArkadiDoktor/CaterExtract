Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand that you are organizing a corporate event on March 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can provide an exceptional catering experience for your guests.  

We specialize in a variety of menus, including kosher options, and can accommodate different dietary needs. Our pricing typically ranges from 35 to 50 dollars per person, depending on the menu selections. We also offer a selection of beverages and can provide staff for setup and service if needed.  

Please let me know the anticipated number of guests so we can tailor a proposal that suits your event. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting around 100 guests, and I appreciate the flexibility in your pricing. However, I would like to clarify if the 35 to 50 dollars per person includes VAT, as that will impact our overall budget.  

Additionally, we are specifically looking for a kosher menu supervised by a reliable authority, as some of our attendees have dietary restrictions. Can you provide more details on your offerings and if beverages are included in the quoted price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can confirm that our pricing does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. For the kosher menu, we are certified under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all necessary requirements.  

Regarding beverages, they are not included in the initial pricing; however, I can offer a package that incorporates a full bar or non-alcoholic options for an additional cost. If you prefer, we can also provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, along with accommodating any additional dietary needs you may have.  

Please let me know if this works for your budget, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying everything. After reviewing the details, we would like to proceed with the kosher menu for 100 guests at a fixed price of 45 dollars per person, which brings us to a total of 4,500 dollars. I understand that VAT will be added on top of this amount. Please confirm that the cancellation policy allows for changes up to one week before the event.  

I truly appreciate your assistance in accommodating our requirements. Once you confirm the final details, including the beverage options, we can move forward with the contract.  

Thank you!
