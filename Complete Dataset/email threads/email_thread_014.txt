Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. We specialize in a variety of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and assorted salads. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Please let us know if you would like to include beverages, as our standard package does not cover bar services.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu you suggested sounds great, although I am concerned about the pricing. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to lower your price to $40 per person? We expect around 100 guests, and including beverages would be a big help as well. Could you also confirm the dietary accommodations available for any guests with allergies?  

I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I completely understand your budget concerns. We can adjust the price to $40 per person for 100 guests, which totals $4,000. However, the price does not include beverages. We can certainly provide options for dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.  

As for the cancellation policy, please note that we require a notice of at least one week before the event. Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
