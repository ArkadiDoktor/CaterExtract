Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming conference scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. We specialize in an array of menu options, including kosher selections, and can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically suggest a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure starts at 45 dollars per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and accommodate up to 150. Please note that the price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can arrange for beverages and a bar service at an additional cost, if you are interested. Let me know your preferences, and I can send over a representative menu for your review.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information regarding the catering options. The mixed menu sounds great, but I would like to confirm a few details. Given the nature of our attendees, can you ensure that the food is under reliable kosher supervision? Additionally, could you provide a clearer breakdown of the beverage options and their pricing?  

If possible, we’re looking at around 100 guests, but we may vary this depending on final RSVPs. I appreciate your flexibility in this regard.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, all our kosher meals are supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards of kashrut. For beverages, we typically offer a selection that includes soft drinks, juices, and a variety of wines at a fixed price per guest, which would be an extra 15 dollars per person.  

For the 100 guests, your total would come to 6,000 dollars, including VAT. We can finalize the details once you confirm the guest count closer to the event date. We also have a flexible cancellation policy allowing changes up to two weeks before the event without penalty, which should provide you with some peace of mind.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best regards,
