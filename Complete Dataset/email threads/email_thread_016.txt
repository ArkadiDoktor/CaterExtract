Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming event. We would be delighted to cater for your corporate gathering scheduled for March 15th.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at $45 per person, which includes a variety of dishes tailored to your needs. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK, ensuring the utmost quality and compliance.  

Please note that beverages are not included in our standard package, but we can arrange a bar service at an additional cost. We can also offer a mixed menu featuring options like grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of pareve desserts.  

I would be happy to provide a sample menu for your review and discuss any dietary accommodations you may require.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the details. The $45 per person rate seems reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss the possibility of a fixed price for the entire event if we confirm a higher number of guests, say around 120. Could you provide a quote based on that?  

Additionally, it would be great to know more about your vegetarian options, as we may have some guests with dietary restrictions. The event will be a formal networking dinner, so presentation is key.  

Thank you, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I appreciate your interest in a fixed price arrangement. For 120 guests, we can offer a package deal at $5,400, which includes all the menu items and necessary staffing for setup and service. This price does include VAT.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian options, like a quinoa salad and stuffed peppers, alongside our meat dishes. I assure you that we will handle all presentation details to match the formal setting of your event.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, and I’ll send over the formal agreement.  

Best wishes,
