Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming gala dinner on December 5th. We specialize in creating exceptional dining experiences and would be thrilled to assist you.  

For your event, I can offer a diverse menu featuring a variety of dishes, including options for meat, dairy, and vegetarian guests. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests, and we can cater up to 200. Please note that the quoted price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we are able to provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. While we don't typically include a bar in our packages, we can arrange beverage service at an additional cost. I would be happy to discuss dietary accommodations as well.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The menu options sound great, and I'm glad to hear that you can provide kosher meals. However, our guest list may be slightly larger than 200, as we expect around 250 attendees. Would you be able to accommodate this number?  

I also wanted to ask if you could provide a few specific menu highlights. We're particularly interested in ensuring there are options for gluten-free guests. Could you please confirm if the $75 per person price remains the same for the larger group?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply and for the update on the guest count. We can indeed accommodate up to 250 guests with an adjusted price of $70 per person for that larger number. For menu highlights, I recommend our herb-crusted roast beef, grilled seasonal vegetables, and a delightful array of desserts, including gluten-free options.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide additional options for gluten-free guests if you let us know the specific needs of your attendees. Please remember that we can also discuss the bar arrangements should you decide to include beverages.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the agreement.  

Best regards,

Thank you for the revised pricing and the menu suggestions. I'm happy to proceed with the arrangement for 250 guests at $70 per person, including VAT. Please prepare the kosher catering under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we will discuss the bar options separately.  

For our records, could you confirm the cancellation policy? I look forward to finalizing this and appreciate your assistance in making our gala a success.
