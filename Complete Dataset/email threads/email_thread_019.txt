Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in creating a memorable culinary experience for your guests.  

Our catering services are designed to be flexible, with a range of menu options available. We typically charge $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, mains, and desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests for this event. I can confirm that our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we are happy to provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

If you would like beverages included, we can certainly discuss that as well, although they are not part of the standard package. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements, and I will ensure they are accommodated.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping we could explore options for a slightly lower price per person, perhaps around $40, especially since we are working with a charity budget. Additionally, could you clarify whether the $45 price includes VAT?  

We would also like to confirm that the setup and staffing for the event would be included in your service, as we want to ensure everything runs smoothly. Lastly, it would be great if you could provide a few examples of the main dishes you would recommend for our guest list.  

Thanks again, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the constraints of a charity budget. I can offer the catering at $40 per person, with VAT included in that price. This package will cover the setup and staffing as well.  

As for the menu, I recommend our popular braised short ribs, herb-crusted salmon, and a vegetarian option of roasted vegetable lasagna. Each dish is designed to impress and cater to diverse palates.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
