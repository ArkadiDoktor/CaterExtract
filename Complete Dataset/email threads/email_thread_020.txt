Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming fundraising gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our team specializes in creating exceptional dining experiences, and we can offer a menu that caters to your guests' preferences.  

For the gala, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with highlights such as grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate dietary restrictions as well, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

In terms of pricing, our services are priced at $75 per person, and this includes setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. Please note that this price does not include VAT, which will be added on top. We typically cater for a minimum of 100 guests and can accommodate up to 300.  

If you're looking for a bar service, we can provide a separate package for beverages. Additionally, all our food is kosher and prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you have any specific requests or adjustments in mind. I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the options for dietary accommodations. I do have a couple of questions regarding the pricing and guest count.  

Is there any flexibility on the price per person if we reach closer to the maximum of 300 guests? Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 includes VAT or if that would be added on top? We want to make sure our budget aligns with your offerings.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick follow-up. We can indeed offer a discount if you confirm the maximum guest count of 300, bringing the price down to $70 per person. However, please note that VAT will still be added on top of this adjusted price.  

I hope this adjustment helps fit your budget. Let me know if there are any other details we can work on to make this event a success.
