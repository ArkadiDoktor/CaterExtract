Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would be delighted to assist you.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, which includes items such as roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and assorted pastries. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $75, which includes VAT. We typically cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can handle up to 200 guests. Please note that beverage service is not included in this price, but we can arrange a bar service if desired.  

If you have specific requirements or additional needs, such as setup and staffing, please let me know, and I will include that in our proposal.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the menu options you provided. Since we are expecting around 150 guests, could you confirm if the per-person pricing would remain the same? Additionally, I am particularly interested in ensuring that all food is kosher. Can you clarify the supervision details?  

Also, I would like to discuss the inclusion of a bar service. Could you provide a separate estimate for that?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up questions. The per-person rate of $75 would indeed remain the same for 150 guests. Regarding kosher supervision, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards.  

For the bar service, we can offer a variety of beverage packages starting at $20 per person. This can include wine, beer, and soft drinks. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this option.  

If everything looks good to you, I can prepare a detailed contract for your review.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests at $75 per person, along with the bar service at $20 per person. This brings the total price to $11,250, including VAT. I appreciate the kosher supervision and the dietary accommodations you're offering.  

Could you please send over the contract with all the details? I would also like to confirm the cancellation policy before finalizing everything.  

Looking forward to your response.
