Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on March 15th, and I would love to assist you with your catering needs.  

We specialize in a variety of menu options, including meat and dairy dishes, with the capability to accommodate different dietary restrictions. Our pricing is typically around $45 per person, which includes setup and service staff. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. VAT is included in this price.  

Additionally, we offer a kosher menu under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council of Greater New York. If you are interested, I can send you a sample menu featuring some of our signature dishes. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Cohen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The corporate gala is indeed a significant event for us, and we want to ensure everything goes smoothly. I appreciate the kosher option, as it aligns with our attendees' needs.  

Could you clarify if beverages are included in the $45 per person price? Also, we may need some accommodations for gluten-free options, as we expect a few guests with dietary restrictions.  

Lastly, would you be open to negotiating the price if we end up with more than 150 guests?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I’m glad to hear that the kosher option fits well with your event. To answer your question, beverages, including soft drinks and water, are not included in the $45 price. We can provide a separate beverage package if you're interested.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly offer gluten-free options in addition to our standard menu. If your guest count exceeds 150, I can offer a revised price of $40 per person for a group of that size.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I will be happy to assist further.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your flexibility and for clarifying the details. I appreciate the adjusted pricing for a larger group and the gluten-free options. Let's proceed with your proposal at $40 per person for up to 200 guests, including the kosher menu and gluten-free accommodations. Please ensure that setup and service staff are included as discussed.  

I will also need to finalize the cancellation terms, so if we decide to go ahead, please send over the contract. Looking forward to working with you!
