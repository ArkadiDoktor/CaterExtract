Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate conference on March 15th. We specialize in creating memorable culinary experiences, and I would love to assist you with this event.  

For a gathering of your size, which I understand will be between 50 to 100 guests, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. Our team can also accommodate various dietary needs, such as vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

If you're looking for beverages, we can provide a full bar package at an additional cost. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to two weeks before the event.  

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements, and I can start drafting a more detailed proposal.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response. I appreciate the details you provided. We're planning for around 75 guests, but I want to ensure we can adjust the numbers if necessary.  

The pricing seems reasonable, but could you clarify if the $45 includes all necessary services such as setup and staffing, or are those additional? I’m also particularly interested in whether the food is kosher and what supervision you have in place.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Samantha,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person does cover setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the day of the event. As for the kosher aspect, all our food is prepared under strict supervision by the Rabbinical Council of Greater Washington, ensuring it meets all kosher requirements.  

If you would like to include the bar package, that would be an additional $15 per person. Given your guest count, I can hold the $45 pricing for you if you confirm by the end of this week.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I’m happy to proceed with your proposal for 75 guests at $45 per person, which includes the setup and staffing, and I would like to include the bar package for an additional $15 per person. This brings the total to $4,500, and I appreciate the VAT being included.  

I’ll confirm final numbers closer to the event, but I expect they won't exceed 100 guests. I’ll also make sure to finalize everything by the end of the week as you suggested.  

Looking forward to working with you!  

Best regards,
