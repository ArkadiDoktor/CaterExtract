Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are planning a corporate gala on October 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can meet your catering needs.  

We specialize in a variety of menus, and our offerings can accommodate both meat and dairy preferences, ensuring all dietary requirements are met. Our pricing structure is typically around $45 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. This price includes VAT and features a delightful selection of dishes, including herb-crusted salmon and roasted vegetable risotto.  

Additionally, we can provide a full bar service at an extra cost or just soft drinks if you prefer. I’d be happy to send you a complete menu and discuss any specific requests you may have.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The corporate gala is indeed an important occasion for us, and I appreciate your menu suggestions. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of points before we proceed.  

We are considering a mixed menu, and it’s essential that the food is kosher, preferably under reliable supervision. Can you confirm if your offerings meet this requirement? Additionally, could you provide a more detailed breakdown of the bar options available? We are trying to finalize our budget, so I would appreciate understanding the total cost for 80 guests, including the bar service.  

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I can confirm that we can provide a kosher menu supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our mixed menu will include options like grilled chicken, quinoa salad, and a variety of desserts.  

Regarding the bar options, we can offer a standard open bar for an additional $20 per person, which would bring your total to $65 per person for 80 guests, including VAT. If you prefer the soft drink option, it would be $45 per person as mentioned earlier.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement. Our cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event without penalty.
