Dear Samantha,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special occasion.

Our catering services offer a variety of menu options, including meat and mixed dishes. We can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free. For the gala, our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, with a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250. This price includes VAT, and I can assure you that all our dishes are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.

Please let me know if you’d like to see a detailed menu, and we can also discuss beverage options, including bar services, that you may want to include.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing looks good, but I would like to clarify what is included in the $75 per person. Does the price cover all food items, or are there additional costs for certain menu choices? Additionally, could you provide a bit more detail on the types of dishes you would suggest for a mixed menu? 

I am also considering whether to include a bar service. If we decide to go with a basic beverage package, how would that affect the overall pricing?

Thank you for your assistance!

Best,

Dear Samantha,

I appreciate your questions. The $75 per person covers a full buffet-style meal, which includes two main dishes, sides, and desserts. If you opt for premium items or specific chef's specials, those may incur additional charges. 

For the mixed menu, I recommend our herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platter, and a selection of seasonal sides. As for the bar service, we can offer a standard beverage package for an additional $20 per person, which includes wine, beer, and soft drinks. 

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with a specific option or if you need further adjustments.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to move forward with the $75 per person option for food and add the standard beverage package for an additional $20 per person. With an expected guest count of around 200, this brings the total to $19,000, including VAT.

Please confirm this arrangement, including the cancellation policy, so we can finalize the details. I look forward to working together for a successful event.

Best,
