Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to offer our catering services for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for January 15, 2024. We specialize in providing high-quality food options and can accommodate various dietary needs.  

Our pricing is structured at £40 per person, which includes a complete buffet service featuring a selection of starters, main courses, and desserts. We serve a mixed menu, including both meat and vegetarian options. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din, if that aligns with your requirements. Please let me know the expected number of guests, as we can cater for a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 200 attendees.  

If you need beverages, we can discuss options for a bar service as well. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds if notice is given at least two weeks in advance.  

I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Tom,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few details. We expect around 120 guests, and I would prefer the menu to be exclusively kosher, if possible. Could you confirm if this would affect the pricing?  

Additionally, I would like to know if the £40 per person includes VAT or if it is added separately. Lastly, I am considering including a drinks package; could you provide me with some options if we decide to go this route?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can confirm that the £40 per person pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top. For an exclusive kosher menu, the price remains the same as long as we maintain the same selection of dishes.  

As for the drinks package, we could offer a standard package at an additional £15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. Let me know if you would like to explore more premium options.  

I hope this clarifies your concerns. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.  

Best,

Thank you for the clarification on the pricing and the drinks package. I would like to confirm the catering for 120 guests at £40 per person, which brings the total to £4,800, excluding VAT. I would also like to add the drinks package for an additional £1,800, making the final total £6,600.  

Please send over the contract and any additional details regarding the setup and staffing for the event. I appreciate your assistance, and I look forward to working with you.
