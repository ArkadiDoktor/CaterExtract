Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming event. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your wedding reception on June 15th. We specialize in mixed menus, and I can assure you that we can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Our pricing structure is set at 75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that our prices do include VAT. 

We take pride in our kosher offerings, which are prepared under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, including wines and non-alcoholic drinks, but a full bar service would be an additional cost.

Let me know if you would like to discuss our menu options further. I can send over a sample menu that includes highlights such as our herb-crusted salmon and seasonal vegetable medley.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few things. Could you provide an estimated final price for 100 guests? Also, could we discuss the possibility of including a bar service in the original price? 

Lastly, I’d appreciate it if you could send over the sample menu at your earliest convenience so we can make our selections. We also need to consider our cancellation policy in case of any changes in plans.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your prompt response. For 100 guests, the total would come to 7,500, which includes VAT. As for the bar service, we can offer a package that includes wine and beer for an additional 1,000. 

I will attach the sample menu for your review shortly. Regarding our cancellation policy, we require at least 30 days’ notice for a full refund; otherwise, a 25% fee will apply.

Let me know if everything looks good, and we can finalize the details.
