Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater for your event. Our standard menu includes a variety of options, including both meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we typically charge $60 per person, which includes VAT. This pricing covers a full dinner service with a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any specific menu preferences in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds promising, but I wanted to clarify if the bar service is included in your quote, as we plan to serve wine and cocktails during the event. Additionally, could you provide more details on the cancellation policy?  

I appreciate your willingness to accommodate dietary needs, as we expect a diverse group of attendees. If we proceed, I would like to finalize the guest count as soon as possible to ensure everything is prepared accordingly.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The bar service is not included in the initial quote, but we can offer a separate package for beverages if you're interested. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event to avoid any fees.  

If you do decide to move forward with the catering, I can confirm a final price of $6,000 for 100 guests, with options to adjust depending on the final count. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
