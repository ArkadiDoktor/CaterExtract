Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on October 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making this day memorable. Our catering services can accommodate a range of dietary needs, ensuring all your guests are satisfied.  

For a wedding of this nature, we offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can serve a minimum of 50 guests up to a maximum of 200. Please note that the quoted price does not include beverages; we can discuss bar options separately.  

If you decide to proceed, we would require a deposit of 30% upon confirmation, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds delightful, and I appreciate the details regarding the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Would you be able to accommodate a price of $45 per person if we commit to 150 guests? Additionally, could you clarify if the $50 includes VAT or if that would be added on top?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in working with us. I can offer you a revised price of $48 per person for 150 guests, which would total $7,200. The pricing does include VAT, so there will be no additional charges in that regard. We also can accommodate any specific dietary requests, such as gluten-free options or vegetarian dishes.  

Please let me know if this works for you, as we would love to secure your date.
