Dear Rebecca,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you're planning a corporate gala on June 15th, and I would love to discuss how our catering services can enhance your event. We specialize in mixed cuisine and can accommodate various dietary preferences.  

Our pricing structure is flexible, with options starting at $50 per person, which includes a selection of hors d'oeuvres, main courses, and desserts. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests. Please note that the price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we offer a range of beverages, but if you would prefer a full bar setup, we can discuss that as well. Our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards.  

I look forward to hearing from you soon to discuss your specific needs.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but we're working with a tighter budget. Would you be able to lower the per person price to $45 if we commit to 150 guests? Additionally, could you confirm if the menu would include options for vegetarian and gluten-free diets?  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rebecca,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the budget constraints. I can offer the price of $45 per person for 150 guests, which brings the total to $6,750. This price includes VAT, and we will ensure there are vegetarian and gluten-free options available on the menu.  

Please confirm if you would like us to proceed with this arrangement, and I will prepare a formal contract.  

Warm regards,
