Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your wedding on April 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special event for you. We specialize in providing a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, and this includes all necessary setup, staffing, and equipment.  

We ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, specifically by the Beth Din of London, and we can discuss whether you would like to include beverages and a bar service for your guests. Our minimum guest count for this package is 50, and we can accommodate up to 200 guests. The final price will include VAT.  

Please let me know if you have any specific menu items in mind or if you would like to see some suggestions. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you've provided. The $75 per person rate sounds reasonable, but could we explore a package that might be slightly lower in price? Additionally, I would like to confirm that the menu can indeed accommodate kosher dietary needs, and I appreciate your mention of the Beth Din supervision.  

We are considering around 120 guests, so if you could also include some representative menu items, that would be helpful. Lastly, I would like to know if the bar service is included in that price or if it is separate.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up and understand your concerns about pricing. For a lower price point, I can offer a reduced package at $70 per person, which would still include a variety of meat and dairy dishes, accommodating up to 120 guests as requested. The bar service would be an additional $15 per person, and we can provide a selection of wines and cocktails.  

As for the menu items, I recommend our herb-marinated chicken, roasted vegetables, and a seasonal salad. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a more detailed menu. The cancellation policy is typically 10 days prior to the event date for a full refund.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
