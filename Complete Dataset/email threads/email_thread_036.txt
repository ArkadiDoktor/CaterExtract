Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining your offerings. The wedding will indeed be on June 15th, and we are expecting approximately 150 guests. I appreciate the pricing range; however, could you clarify if the lower end of your range includes a full meal with appetizers and desserts? Also, we would like to ensure that the food is kosher under proper supervision.  

Finally, do you provide a bar service as part of your catering package, or is that something we would need to arrange separately? Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person option does include a full meal with appetizers and desserts, tailored to your preferences. I can confirm that our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, providing peace of mind for your guests.  

Regarding the bar service, we do not include alcohol in our standard package, but we can recommend a partner company that specializes in bar services if that would be helpful. If we proceed with an agreement, I can finalize the details and provide you with a fixed total price.  

Please let me know if this meets your needs, and I look forward to working together to create a wonderful experience for your guests.  

Warm regards,
