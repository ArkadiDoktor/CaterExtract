Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I’m with Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15, and I would love to assist you with the catering.  

We specialize in providing a diverse range of menu options tailored to suit various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free choices. For your event, I would recommend a mixed menu featuring a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can offer a price of $60 per person, which includes VAT. This pricing is based on a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests.  

All our food is kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all dietary requirements. While we do not include a bar in our standard package, we can arrange beverage service upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu in more detail or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response. The $60 per person sounds reasonable, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we were to increase the guest count. We are expecting around 80 to 100 attendees, and I want to ensure we are getting the best value.  

Also, could you provide some examples of the main courses and desserts you typically offer? I want to ensure they align with our guests' preferences. Lastly, what are your cancellation terms in case we need to make changes as the event date approaches?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. We can certainly offer a reduced price of $55 per person for 100 guests or more, which I hope helps with your budget. Our main courses typically include options like herb-crusted chicken, grilled salmon, and a delicious vegetarian risotto. For desserts, we often feature a rich chocolate mousse and a seasonal fruit tart.  

Regarding cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks before the event for a full refund of the deposit. After that, we can discuss any potential adjustments.  

Please let me know if this works for you. I’m looking forward to finalizing the details.  

Best,
