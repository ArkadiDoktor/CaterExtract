Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Klein, and I’m with Gourmet Gatherings. We specialize in catering for corporate events, and I understand you are planning a significant gathering on March 15th. I would love to discuss how we can provide a delightful dining experience for your attendees.  

Our menus typically feature a mix of meat and dairy options, with particular attention to dietary needs. We can accommodate a range of preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free. For a complete meal, we charge $45 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT, which will be added at the end.  

If you have a guest count in mind, I can provide tailored suggestions and finalize the menu. We generally work with a minimum of 50 guests and can comfortably serve up to 200.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Klein

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The event is indeed for our annual corporate retreat, and we anticipate around 120 guests. I appreciate the pricing details you've provided. However, could you let me know if any of the options can be adjusted to fit a tighter budget? Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify whether the food will be kosher and if it meets any specific supervision standards.  

Lastly, are beverages included in your $45 price?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I understand budget constraints are important, and I can offer a revised package at $40 per person if we simplify the menu to include fewer options. Regarding kosher requirements, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the local Orthodox Union.  

The $45 price does not include beverages, but I can provide a bar service at an additional cost of $15 per person, featuring a selection of wines and soft drinks. Let me know what works best for your event, and I can draft a menu accordingly.  

Looking forward to finalizing this with you.  

Best,

Please confirm that this includes VAT and that we can finalize the menu soon. I look forward to working with you to ensure a successful event.
