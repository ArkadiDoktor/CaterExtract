Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are planning a significant corporate gala on April 15th, and I would love to assist you with the catering.  

We specialize in diverse menu options and can accommodate anywhere from 100 to 300 guests. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a three-course meal and an array of appetizers. We also offer a selection of beverages, though they are priced separately. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss menu options or any specific dietary needs your guests may have. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed quite important to us, and I appreciate your help. The pricing of $45 per person sounds reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if that includes VAT or if it is added on top.  

Additionally, we may have up to 250 guests, and I would like to explore options for a dairy menu, as well as any accommodations for vegan attendees. It would be great to have a few sample dishes as part of the selection.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $45 per person does not include VAT, which is an additional 10%. We can certainly provide a dairy menu that includes vegetarian options as well as vegan dishes.  

For the menu, I suggest items like gourmet stuffed mushrooms, a selection of seasonal salads, and a delightful dairy chocolate mousse for dessert. We can accommodate up to 250 guests comfortably, and I can assure you we're proficient in setup and staffing to ensure everything runs smoothly for your event.  

If we finalize the agreement before the end of the week, we can offer you a cancellation policy that allows changes up to five days before the event without any penalties. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed information. I appreciate the clarification on the pricing and the menu options you’ve provided. Given the accommodations for dietary preferences and the cancellation policy, I would like to proceed with the catering at the price of $45 per person, plus VAT. That would bring the total to $11,250 for 250 guests.  

Please go ahead with the arrangements, and let’s finalize the details at your earliest convenience. I’m excited to see everything come together for the gala.  

Best,
