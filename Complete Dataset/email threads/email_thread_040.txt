Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the inclusivity of dietary accommodations. We are expecting around 100 guests, so the pricing looks manageable. However, I would like to confirm if the total price includes any additional charges for service or equipment.  

Also, could you please clarify the cancellation policy? I want to ensure everything is set in case we need to make any changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,
