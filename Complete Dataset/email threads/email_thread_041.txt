Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would be delighted to assist you.  

For a gathering of between 50 to 100 guests, we can offer a mixed menu option that includes a variety of meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and this includes setup and serving staff. Please note that prices are exclusive of VAT, which is an additional 20%.  

We are also able to accommodate dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian and gluten-free options, upon request. If you need any beverages or a bar service, we can offer that as an add-on. Additionally, our food is kosher and is prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific preferences for the menu.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the details regarding the kosher supervision. Could we discuss the possibility of adjusting the price a bit? Given our budget constraints, I was hoping to bring it down to around $40 per person. Additionally, could you confirm if drinks will be included in that price?  

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Sarah,  

I understand your concern regarding the pricing. While our standard rate is $45 per person, I can offer you a revised price of $42 per person if you can guarantee a minimum of 75 guests. Regarding the beverages, they are not included in the base price, but we can provide a beverage package at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a draft contract for your review.
