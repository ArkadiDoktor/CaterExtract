Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a wedding reception on November 15th and are in need of catering services. We specialize in providing high-quality food for events just like yours.  

Our catering packages start at $75 per person and can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests, with flexibility for up to 150 guests. We offer a variety of menu options, including mixed dishes and can cater to specific dietary requests. If your event requires kosher meals, we can provide those as well, supervised by the Orthodox Rabbinical Council.  

Please let me know your preferences and any additional requirements, so I can send over a proposed menu and further details.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The wedding is indeed on November 15th, and we're expecting around 100 guests. I appreciate the starting price you mentioned, but I was hoping to explore if there’s any room for negotiation based on our budget.  

Additionally, could you clarify whether the $75 per person includes VAT? We are also considering adding a bar service for cocktails. If possible, please include a few highlights from your menu.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand budget constraints, and I can offer you a package at $70 per person if you confirm by the end of this week. This price does include VAT but does not include bar service, which we can provide for an additional $15 per person.  

For your menu, I can suggest dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet salads. We are also happy to accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to confirm the catering for 100 guests at $70 per person, which brings the total to $7,000. I would also like to include the bar service for an additional $15 per person, totaling $1,500.  

This brings our final price to $8,500, which I believe fits our budget. Please prepare a contract that outlines the details, including the cancellation terms, and any other necessary information.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
