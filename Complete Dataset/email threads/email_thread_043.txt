Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your inquiry regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for events like yours. Our offerings include a delicious mixed menu featuring options such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and an assortment of gourmet salads.  

We typically charge a fixed price of $65 per person, which includes all food items and setup. For your event, we can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests. Please note that our prices include VAT.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details about the menu and pricing. I wanted to confirm if your food is kosher and under what supervision, as several attendees require it. Additionally, could you clarify if beverages are included in the $65 price?  

If we decide to proceed, I may also need to explore some dietary accommodations for guests with allergies. We expect closer to 120 guests, so if you could provide a final quote based on that, it would be helpful.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards. The $65 per person does not include beverages or a bar, but we can arrange a drink package for an additional $15 per person if you’re interested.  

For dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide options for gluten-free and vegetarian guests. For your guest count of 120, the total would be $7,800, including VAT. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the arrangements.  

Best,
