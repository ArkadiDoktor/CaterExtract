Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our typical offering includes a three-course meal featuring a selection of meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, with a pricing structure of $75 per person, which includes VAT. We also offer a variety of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, to ensure all your guests are satisfied.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to lower the price to $65 per person? Also, could you confirm whether beverages will be included in this price, or will that be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding the budget. We can offer you the price of $70 per person, which will still include all meal components and VAT. However, please note that beverages would be an additional charge, typically around $15 per guest for a standard bar package.  

If you decide to proceed with the adjusted pricing, we can finalize the menu and any additional requirements. Please let me know how you would like to move forward.  

Warm regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the revised pricing. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the $70 per person offer for 120 guests, which brings us to a total of $8,400. Please ensure that all dietary accommodations are taken care of, and let's include the standard bar package as discussed. I will send over a contract shortly.  

Also, could you clarify the cancellation policy? I want to review that before we finalize everything.
