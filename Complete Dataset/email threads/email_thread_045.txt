Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services for various events, and I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th. 

We offer a range of menu options that can accommodate from 50 to 150 guests. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person charge, which is set at $75. This includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, with the option for kosher supervision under the Star-K certification. If you require beverages or a bar service, we can discuss that separately.

Our cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event, and we ensure that all dietary accommodations are met, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. I would be happy to provide a detailed menu for your review.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the catering options. The corporate gala is indeed quite important for us, and I appreciate your willingness to accommodate dietary needs. However, could you clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT? Also, could we possibly negotiate the price down to $65 per person if we confirm the minimum of 50 guests?

Additionally, do you have any popular dishes that you recommend for this type of event? 

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person pricing does not include VAT, which is an additional 10%. However, I can agree to a price of $65 per person if you confirm at least 75 guests. As for the menu, our popular dishes include herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and our signature chocolate mousse, which have always been well-received.

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a detailed proposal.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for clarifying the details regarding the pricing and VAT. I would like to move forward with the $65 per person rate for 75 guests, bringing the total to $4,875. Please include the kosher supervision under the Star-K, and I would appreciate a formal proposal including the recommended menu items. 

Looking forward to finalizing this arrangement.
