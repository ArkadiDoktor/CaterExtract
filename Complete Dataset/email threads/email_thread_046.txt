Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, with a minimum guest count of 50 and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT and covers the full setup, serving staff, and all necessary equipment.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or any other details.

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety of options you offer, especially the kosher meals. However, I would like to clarify a few points before moving forward.  

Could you confirm whether the price of $50 per person includes beverages, or would that be an additional cost? Also, we are expecting around 175 guests, so I would like to understand if the price would remain the same for that number. If we decide to increase our guest count, would there be a cap on how many we could ultimately accommodate?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The pricing of $50 per person does not include beverages; we can offer a bar package at an additional cost depending on your preferences. For your expected guest count of 175, the price would remain the same, but we can accommodate up to 200 guests if needed.  

As for cancellation terms, we require notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of the deposit. I can also provide a sample menu highlighting some popular dishes, including our herb-roasted chicken and assorted vegan options.  

Let me know if you have any more questions or if you'd like to move forward.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for the clarifications. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the catering for 175 guests at the total cost of $8,750, which includes the VAT. We will arrange for beverages separately and will confirm the specific menu items shortly. Please let me know if you can send over a contract reflecting these details and your cancellation policy.  

Looking forward to working together to make this event a success.
