For your wedding, we recommend a three-course meal that could include roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options, ensuring all your guests are well catered for.  

Our pricing is structured at £45 per person, which includes VAT, and we can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. Please let us know if you would like to include a bar service, as this is available at an additional cost.

Hi James,  

Thank you for the quick response. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate your flexibility with dietary options. However, I would like to clarify a couple of points before we proceed.  

Could you confirm if the price of £45 per person includes everything, or are there additional costs we should anticipate, particularly concerning staffing and equipment setup? Also, while we are considering the bar service, I’d prefer to keep the overall cost down. Is there any room for negotiation on the per-person price if we decide to go with a simpler menu?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,  
Rachel Miller

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your thoughtful questions. The £45 per person includes the meal, basic setup, and service staff for the event. If you choose to simplify the menu, we could lower the price to £40 per person while still offering a delightful meal experience.  

As for the bar service, we can provide a package that starts at an additional £15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. If you have specific drinks in mind, please let me know, and I can adjust the package accordingly.  

Please also note that our cancellation policy allows for full refunds if canceled more than 30 days in advance, which I hope provides some reassurance.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi James,  

Thank you for clarifying the details and adjusting the pricing. I appreciate your willingness to work with us. I would like to proceed with the £40 per person option with a mixed menu, including roasted chicken and vegetarian options, for 100 guests.  

Please confirm that this price includes VAT and that the food will be kosher under the supervision of the local rabbi. I would also like to keep the bar service off the table for this event to maintain our budget.  

Once I receive confirmation, I will finalize the arrangements.  

Best regards,  
Rachel Miller
