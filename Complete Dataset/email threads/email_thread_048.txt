Dear Emily,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on December 5th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Based on your estimated guest count of 50 to 75 people, I can offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and vegetarian options.  

Our pricing structure is typically around $45 per person, which covers a full buffet setup, including appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This price includes VAT, and we can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free or vegetarian options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific dishes in mind. I look forward to your response.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the pricing details you've provided. However, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes beverages or if that would be an additional charge? Also, I’m curious about the kosher certification for the menu. Since we have some guests with specific dietary needs, it would be great to know if you can accommodate those as well.  

If we proceed with your services, could you also outline your cancellation policy?  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Dear Emily,  

I appreciate your questions and am happy to clarify. The $45 per person includes the meal, but beverages are priced separately. We offer a selection of soft drinks and wines starting at an additional $15 per person.  

Regarding kosher options, our menu can be certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can ensure that all food meets this standard. We can also accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegan and gluten-free options.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund. I hope this answers your queries, and I look forward to your thoughts on moving forward.
