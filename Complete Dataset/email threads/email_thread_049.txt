Dear Emma,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Culinary Delights for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would be thrilled to assist you in making your event memorable.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with a selection of dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of gourmet salads. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes setup and service staff. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and all prices include VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority, ensuring that all dietary requirements are met. We would also be happy to discuss beverage options, including a bar service, should you be interested.  

Please let me know your thoughts or if you have any specific requests.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu options sound fantastic, especially the herb-roasted chicken. However, I was hoping to clarify a few points before moving forward.  

Could you confirm if the $45 per person includes beverages, or would that be an additional cost? Also, while I appreciate the kosher offerings, I'm wondering if you could provide more information about the supervision details. Finally, would it be possible to adjust the pricing if we end up with a smaller guest count, say around 50?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Emma,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person does not include beverages; we can offer a bar package starting at an additional $15 per person. Regarding the kosher supervision, we work with Rabbi Cohen, who ensures all our meals comply with kosher standards.  

As for pricing, we can certainly offer a modified rate for a smaller group. If you have 50 guests, the price per person can be adjusted to $50. This will still include VAT and the same menu options.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarification and the revised pricing. After discussing with my team, we would like to confirm the catering for 50 guests at $50 per person, with the mixed menu and kosher supervision by Rabbi Cohen. We will also include the bar package, bringing the total to $3,250 including VAT.  

Please send over the contract and any additional details regarding the setup and cancellation policy. We are looking forward to a successful event!
