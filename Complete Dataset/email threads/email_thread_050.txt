Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming conference. We specialize in providing quality food for corporate events, and I am confident we can meet your needs. 

For a gathering of this nature, we offer a mixed menu that includes options such as grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of vegetarian dishes. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. This rate applies to a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150 guests. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegan options.

On the day of the event, we will provide setup and staffing as part of our service. Please let us know the event date, and we can discuss further details.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt reply. The event is scheduled for April 15th, and we expect around 80 guests. I appreciate the proposed menu and the inclusion of dietary accommodations. However, I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, as we were hoping to keep the budget a bit lower. 

Additionally, could you clarify if the menu is kosher and under what supervision? We are keen on ensuring that our food aligns with our guests' dietary needs. 

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your quick follow-up. I can certainly offer you a revised rate of $40 per person for the 80 guests, which brings the total to $3,200. This includes VAT and the necessary staffing. As for the kosher status, our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet high standards.

Please note that while we can include a selection of beverages, a full bar service would be an additional charge. 

If this works for you, we can move forward with the reservation. 

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your adjustments. The new price of $3,200 is acceptable, and I appreciate the kosher certification. Let’s go ahead and confirm the catering for 80 guests on April 15th with the mixed menu and dietary accommodations. 

Please send over the contract so we can finalize everything. I understand the cancellation policy is a 14-day notice; that works for us. 

Looking forward to working together.

Best,
