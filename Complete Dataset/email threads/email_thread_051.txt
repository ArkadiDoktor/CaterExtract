Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your catering needs. We are excited to assist with the upcoming charity gala scheduled for November 15th. We offer a variety of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. 

For this event, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 200. Please note that our prices include VAT. 

As for beverages, we can provide a bar service at an additional cost if you wish. We also offer various dietary options, including vegetarian and gluten-free meals. Please let me know if you have any specific requests, and I would be happy to assist. 

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but we were hoping to reduce the cost slightly, as our budget is tight. Would you be able to offer a discount for a guest count closer to the minimum of 100? Also, can you clarify if the $45 per person includes the bar service or if that would be an additional charge?  

I appreciate your flexibility on this matter.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand the need to stay within budget. If you can guarantee at least 125 guests, I can offer the price at $42 per person. This would still include the setup and staffing but would not include the bar service, which remains an additional $15 per person. Please keep in mind that we require a final headcount a week before the event, and our cancellation policy allows for cancellations up to 48 hours prior to the event with a full refund.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I can confirm 125 guests, so let's proceed with the $42 per person price, and I will arrange for the bar service as well. Please send over the contract, and I will review the cancellation terms once more. Looking forward to a successful gala!
