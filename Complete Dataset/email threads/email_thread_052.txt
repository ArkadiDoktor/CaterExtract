Dear Amelia,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your gathering. Can you please share more details about the type of event you are organizing, including the estimated number of guests and any specific dietary requirements?  

We offer a range of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. Our pricing typically starts at $30 per person, and we can accommodate groups of 50 to 150 guests. This price includes VAT. Additionally, we can arrange for a bar service if needed, though that would be an extra cost.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thanks for your prompt response. We are organizing a corporate dinner, and we expect around 80 guests. Since we have a mix of dietary preferences, could you please let me know if you can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options as well?  

I appreciate the starting price you mentioned, but would you be able to provide a more detailed breakdown of the menu items you can offer? I’d also like to confirm if the bar service is included in that price.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Amelia,  

Thank you for the additional details. For your corporate dinner, we can certainly provide a varied menu that includes meat, vegetarian, and gluten-free options. Some of our popular dishes include grilled chicken with herbs, a quinoa salad, and a delicious chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Regarding the bar service, it is not included in the initial price but can be added for a flat fee of $15 per person. If you decide to proceed with our services, the total for 80 guests would be $2,400, which includes VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
