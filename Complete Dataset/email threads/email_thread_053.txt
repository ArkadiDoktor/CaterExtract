Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring options like grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of vegetarian dishes. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. We can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests, and the price includes VAT.  

Additionally, if you require kosher meals, we can provide those under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. Please let us know your beverage needs, as our standard package does not include a bar service, but we can arrange it at an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate the pricing clarity. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Would you consider lowering it to $40 per person?  

Also, we expect around 150 guests. Could you confirm if the kosher meals would be available for this number? Lastly, we are interested in including a bar service for the evening; could you provide an estimate for that?  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your request for a lower price. We can offer $42 per person, which still allows us to maintain the quality of our service. This price will also include the kosher meals for your expected 150 guests.  

For the bar service, we can provide a package that includes beer, wine, and soft drinks, which would be an additional $15 per person. Please let me know if that works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for considering my proposal. I am happy to accept your offer of $42 per person for the catering and will go ahead with the bar service at $15 per person. This brings our total to $8,550 for 150 guests, including VAT and kosher meals.  

Please confirm the arrangements for setup and staffing, and I would like to clarify the cancellation policy just in case. Looking forward to working together on this event.  

Best,  
Sarah
