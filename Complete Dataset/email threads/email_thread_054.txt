Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for such events and would be delighted to assist you.  

For a gala of this nature, we recommend a mixed menu, featuring a variety of meat and dairy options to cater to all your guests' preferences. Our pricing structure is generally based on a per-person basis, typically ranging from $45 to $65, depending on the selected dishes and any additional services you may require. This price includes VAT.  

We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests, and our team will ensure that everything is set up well before the event begins. Additionally, we can provide staffing for service, if needed.  

Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or discuss any specific dietary needs for your guests.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

I appreciate your prompt response. The range you provided sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few details before moving forward.  

Could you provide a breakdown of some representative dishes included in the mixed menu? Additionally, we're particularly interested in ensuring that at least a portion of the menu is kosher. Can you confirm this and the supervision under which it is certified? Also, do your packages include beverages, or would that be an additional cost?  

Thank you for your help.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can confirm that we offer kosher options under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. For the mixed menu, we typically include dishes such as herb-marinated chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads.  

Regarding beverages, we can include a selection of soft drinks as part of the package, but alcoholic beverages would be an additional cost. If you prefer, we can discuss a bar service tailored to your needs.  

If you would like to proceed, we can finalize the cost at $55 per person for 150 guests, which will include VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best wishes,  
Daniel
