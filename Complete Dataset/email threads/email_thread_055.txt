Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding reception on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in creating a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

Our catering services can accommodate between 75 and 150 guests, with a pricing structure of $45 per person. This includes a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, along with a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can also provide a kosher menu under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority if that is required.  

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a tasting or if there are specific dietary accommodations you have in mind. Additionally, our prices include VAT, so there are no hidden charges.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and detailed proposal. The $45 per person price is reasonable, but I would like to know if you can offer a reduced rate for a guest count closer to 75, as we are still finalizing our RSVPs.  

Also, could you clarify if the menu includes beverages, or would that be an additional cost? We want to ensure we can accommodate our guests' preferences, including any dietary restrictions.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

I appreciate your inquiry regarding the pricing. For a minimum of 75 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person, which would total $3,000 for the event. As for beverages, we typically do not include them in our catering packages, but we can provide a bar service for an additional cost.  

Regarding dietary options, we can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian requests. If you have any specific dishes in mind, feel free to share, and we can adjust the menu accordingly.  

Let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
