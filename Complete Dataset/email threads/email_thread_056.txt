Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided. We are indeed expecting around 100 guests, and I am particularly interested in ensuring that some dishes are kosher. Could you confirm if your menu can meet this requirement and under what supervision?  

Additionally, could we discuss the inclusion of a bar service? Our budget is quite tight, and I want to ensure we can manage costs effectively. Would you be able to offer a fixed price for the total service, including the kosher certification and beverages?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that we can provide a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary laws are adhered to. The mixed menu can include items like herb-roasted chicken, vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads.  

Regarding the bar service, we can include a modest open bar for an additional $20 per person. If you would like to proceed with the kosher menu and the bar option for 100 guests, the total would come to $9,500, which includes VAT. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.
