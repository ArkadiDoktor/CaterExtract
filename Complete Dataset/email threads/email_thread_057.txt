Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We are delighted to have the opportunity to assist you in making this day special. Our catering services can accommodate a range of dietary preferences, ensuring that all your guests feel included.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically suggest a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, and we can certainly provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local Orthodox Rabbinate. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests and can cater for up to 200. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

If you are interested, we can also offer a selection of beverages, but these would be charged separately. Our menu features a variety of dishes, including herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable medley, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify if the $75 per person includes any options for guests with dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free or vegan meals. Additionally, could you confirm your cancellation policy? That is something very important to us as we finalize our plans.  

Also, while I appreciate the mixed menu option, could you provide more details on the specific dishes included and the drink options available? I anticipate around 150 guests, so it would be great to get a better understanding.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegan options as part of our menu, and I assure you that we can cater to your guests' dietary needs without compromising on taste.  

Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least 30 days prior to the event. If canceled within 30 days, we retain a 50% deposit. Regarding the drink options, we can offer a selection of wines and non-alcoholic beverages, priced separately. For your wedding of approximately 150 guests, the total would come to $11,250, which excludes VAT.  

I hope this additional information helps you in your decision-making. Please feel free to reach out if you need anything else.
