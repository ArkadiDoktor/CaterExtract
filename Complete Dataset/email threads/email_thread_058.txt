Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate banquet on December 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. We specialize in providing high-quality meals that are tailored to your needs.  

For a gathering of between 50 and 100 guests, we offer a mixed menu featuring an array of options, including grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of gourmet vegetarian dishes. Our pricing is set at $60 per person, which includes setup and staffing. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

If you have any dietary requirements or specific requests, such as kosher supervision, please let us know, and we can accommodate accordingly. We also offer a variety of beverage options, but please specify if you would like to include a bar service.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the quick response. The menu sounds great, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points. We anticipate around 80 guests, and it’s essential that the food is kosher. Can you confirm that your meals are under appropriate supervision?  

Additionally, could you let me know if the bar service is included in the quoted price or if that would be an additional cost? Once I have this information, I can move forward with the planning.  

Best,  
Emma

Hi Emma,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. Our meals are indeed kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards. Regarding the bar service, it is not included in the initial quote of $60 per person; however, we can provide a full bar package for an additional $25 per person.  

If you decide to proceed with the 80 guests, the total would come to $6,800, including VAT, without the bar service. Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any further adjustments needed.  

Best,  
Michael
