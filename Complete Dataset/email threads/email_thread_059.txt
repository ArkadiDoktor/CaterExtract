Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event, which I understand will have a guest list of around 100 people.  

We specialize in a mixed menu, featuring options such as herb-crusted beef, grilled salmon, and a variety of vegetarian dishes. I can assure you that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets high standards.  

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing. Please note that VAT is added on top of the quoted price. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

If you have any questions or need adjustments to suit your preferences, feel free to let me know.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the details. The menu options sound fantastic. However, I was hoping we could discuss the price a little further. Given our budget constraints, is there any possibility of lowering the per-person cost? Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are included in that price, or would they be charged separately?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. While our standard rate is $75 per person, I can offer a slight reduction to $70 per person if we can keep the guest count at a minimum of 80. Regarding beverages, we can include non-alcoholic drinks, but alcoholic beverages would be charged separately.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I can agree to the $70 per person rate for 100 guests, which makes the total $7,000. I understand the non-alcoholic beverages will be included, and I will handle the bar arrangements separately. Could you please confirm that this price includes VAT? Also, can we finalize the cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can proceed.  

Best,
