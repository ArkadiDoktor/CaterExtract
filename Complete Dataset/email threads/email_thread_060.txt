Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response and for outlining your offerings. I appreciate the kosher certification and the range of dietary options available. However, I wanted to clarify if the $50 per person price includes VAT or if it will be added separately. Additionally, could you provide some representative menu items? While I am inclined to proceed, I’d like to ensure everything aligns with our budget and expectations for the event.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your inquiry. The pricing of $50 per person does include VAT, which should help simplify the budgeting process for the gala. As for the menu, we can offer options such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads. We can also provide dessert options like chocolate mousse and fruit tarts.  

If you are looking to finalize arrangements, I would be happy to secure the date for you. Please let me know if you have a specific guest count in mind, as our minimum is 100 guests and our maximum is 150.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the detailed information. I appreciate the clarity regarding the pricing and VAT included. I would like to proceed with your proposal for 120 guests at the agreed price of $50 per person, which comes to a total of $6,000. Please confirm that this includes the setup, staffing, and equipment as discussed. Additionally, I would like to ensure that the bar service is not included, as we will be handling that separately. I am looking forward to working together to make this gala a success.  

Best regards,
