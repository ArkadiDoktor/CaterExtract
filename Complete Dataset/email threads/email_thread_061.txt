Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your event. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for various occasions, and I would be happy to assist you with your upcoming event on November 15th.  

For your gathering, we offer a diverse menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at a rate of $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. All our food is kosher and is prepared under the strict supervision of the O.U.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, including soft drinks and coffee, but a full bar service would be an additional cost. We also cater to dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

If you could provide more details about your guest count and any specific menu requests, I can prepare a tailored proposal for you.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed information. I appreciate the kosher certification and your willingness to accommodate dietary restrictions. I am currently looking at around 75 guests, but I may need to adjust that number based on RSVPs.  

Regarding the menu, could you provide a few example dishes? I'm particularly interested in options that would appeal to a diverse group. Also, if we were to include a full bar, what would the additional cost look like?  

Lastly, could you clarify your cancellation policy? I want to ensure we have flexibility in case of unforeseen changes.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your email. For a guest count of 75, the total cost would come to $3,375, which still includes VAT. As for the menu, I recommend our signature dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, stuffed eggplant, and a selection of gourmet salads. If you would like a full bar service, the additional cost would be approximately $1,200.  

Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks before the event. If canceled within that time frame, we would retain a 25% deposit. Should you have any more questions or need further adjustments, please let me know.  

Warm regards,
