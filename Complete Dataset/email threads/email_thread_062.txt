Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your catering needs. I understand that you are organizing a corporate gala on March 15, and I would be delighted to provide our catering services for this occasion.  

We specialize in a mixed menu, and I can offer a selection that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring that there is something for everyone. Our pricing structure is set at a fixed rate of $45 per person, which includes a variety of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests for this event, and I want to confirm that our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

In addition to the meal, we can discuss beverage options, which are available at an extra cost. All prices include VAT. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements to consider, and I will be happy to prepare accommodations accordingly.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hello Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The fixed rate of $45 per person sounds reasonable, but I was hoping we could negotiate the price a bit, considering we may end up on the higher end of the guest count. Additionally, could you clarify if the beverages would be separate from the meal pricing?  

It would be great to have a menu that highlights some of your signature dishes. Also, please confirm the cancellation terms in case we have to make adjustments as the date approaches.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. I can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person if you confirm the minimum of 100 guests. Regarding beverages, they would indeed be separate from the meal pricing, but we can create a tailored package to meet your needs.  

As for the cancellation terms, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for any changes or cancellations. I will also prepare a sample menu highlighting our popular dishes, such as herb-crusted chicken and a selection of gourmet vegetarian options.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
