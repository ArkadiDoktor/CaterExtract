Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our menu features a variety of options, including a selection of meat and dairy dishes, which can accommodate various dietary needs. We can provide kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary requirements are met.  

Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal and coffee station. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT. Additionally, we can discuss beverage options separately if you're interested in including a bar service.  

If you have any specific menu items in mind or additional requests, please let me know, and I can create a more tailored proposal for you.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss the possibility of adjusting the per-person rate slightly or perhaps modifying the menu to lower costs. We expect around 100 guests, which I believe is manageable. Also, could you confirm if the $75 includes VAT or if that will be added later?  

We do want to ensure that the menu is appealing to a wide range of dietary preferences, so if you could provide a few examples of the dishes you would recommend, that would be great.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the pricing. Given your expected guest count of around 100, I can offer you a revised rate of $70 per person, which will still include a three-course meal and coffee station. The $70 is exclusive of VAT, which is an additional 20%.  

For the menu, I recommend our herb-roasted chicken, a seasonal vegetable risotto, and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert. We can also provide vegetarian options, gluten-free dishes, and other accommodations upon request. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a draft contract for your review.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the updated proposal. I appreciate the flexibility on the pricing and the menu suggestions you've shared. The revised rate of $70 per person sounds good, and I would like to proceed with the contract based on that price. Please ensure that all meals are kosher as discussed.  

I would also like to confirm that the beverages will be excluded, and I will reach out separately if we decide to add a bar service. Regarding the cancellation policy, could you clarify that for me?  

Once I have that information, I will finalize everything on my end.  

Best,
