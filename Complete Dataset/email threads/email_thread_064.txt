Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your event scheduled on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services.

Our pricing typically ranges from $35 to $50 per person, depending on the final menu you choose. We can also provide a selection of beverages, though please note that this is an additional cost. We ensure all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Kashrut Authority.  

Could you please share the expected number of guests? Our minimum is 50, and we can accommodate up to 150.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We expect around 80 guests for the event. I like the idea of a mixed menu, but I would like to clarify the inclusion of beverages. Can you provide me with more details on the beverage options and pricing? Additionally, can we ensure that any dietary restrictions are accommodated?  

I appreciate the kosher supervision, but could you confirm if VAT is included in your pricing? Lastly, if I were to proceed with your services, what would the cancellation policy look like?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. For the beverage options, we offer a range of soft drinks, juices, and a few select wines, typically priced around $15 per person, which would be added to the base menu price. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and nut-free options.  

Regarding the pricing, our quoted range does not include VAT, which is an additional 10%. If you decide to proceed, the total cost for 80 guests would be $4,000, inclusive of the mixed menu and dietary accommodations. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
