Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you on this special occasion.  

Our catering services offer a range of options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK. We can accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian options as well.  

For pricing, our standard fee is $50 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can handle up to 200 guests. Please note that this price is before VAT, which is an additional 20%.  

If you are interested, I would be happy to send you a sample menu with some highlights.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing seems reasonable, though I would like to clarify a couple of things before moving forward. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to reduce the price to $45 per person? Additionally, could you confirm whether beverages, including a bar service, are included in this package?  

I appreciate your willingness to accommodate dietary needs, and I would love to see the sample menu you mentioned.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your quick reply. I understand your budget concerns and can agree to the $45 per person pricing. However, please note that the bar service is not included in this package; we can certainly arrange it for an additional fee, if you're interested.  

I will attach a sample menu that includes some popular dishes like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of desserts. I hope this will help you in your decision-making process.  

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to proceed with the agreement.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised pricing and the sample menu. I appreciate your flexibility. I have reviewed the menu, and everything looks fantastic. I would like to proceed with the catering at $45 per person for 100 guests, which brings the total to $4,500, plus VAT. Please confirm that this includes setup and staffing but excludes the bar service.  

We will also agree to the cancellation policy outlined in your initial email. Looking forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the details.  

Thank you!
