Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater for your event, and I want to assure you that we can provide a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

Our catering services typically include a variety of menu options, and I can offer a selection of meat and dairy dishes, as well as pareve options for dietary restrictions. We also ensure all our food is kosher, supervised by the local Kashrut Council.  

For pricing, we generally work on a per-person basis, and I recommend a range of $50 to $75 per guest depending on the menu choices. We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests. Please let me know if you would like me to send over a sample menu or if you have specific dishes in mind.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response. I appreciate the details you provided. I would love to see a sample menu, particularly any standout dishes you think would impress our guests.  

Regarding the pricing, can you provide a fixed price for 150 guests, including VAT? Also, do you offer any beverage packages, or is that something we would need to arrange separately?  

I look forward to your reply.  

Best,
