Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering services for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Our company specializes in providing quality food for large gatherings, and we can offer a diverse menu that can cater to various dietary needs.  

Based on your estimated guest count of 100 to 150, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. The pricing typically runs at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We also offer a selection of kosher meals under strict supervision from the London Beth Din. Additionally, we can arrange for a bar package, but that would be an extra cost.  

Once you confirm the number of guests, we can finalize the menu and any specific dishes you would like to include. Our team will also handle the setup and staffing requirements for the evening. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or dietary accommodations to consider.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thanks for the prompt reply and the detailed information. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to negotiate it a bit. Given our budget constraints, would you be open to reducing the price to £40 per person? We are still finalizing the guest count, but it will likely fall between 120 and 140.  

I appreciate that you provide kosher options and the supervision details. Could you clarify if the bar will be an additional cost and what that would entail? Finally, could you provide some examples of the menu items you offer?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stick within your budget. I can offer the price of £40 per person for a minimum of 120 guests, which should work for your expected count. However, please keep in mind that the bar package will indeed be additional, typically starting at £15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

As for the menu, some highlights include grilled chicken skewers, a gourmet cheese platter, and a hearty vegetarian lasagna, all of which can be made kosher. I can provide a full menu list once we finalize the agreement.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed from there.  

Kind regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for accommodating my request and providing additional details. I am happy to confirm the agreement at £40 per person for 120 guests, which brings the total to £4,800, including VAT. I understand that the bar will be an additional £15 per person.  

We would like to proceed with the mixed menu, ensuring that kosher options are available under the London Beth Din supervision. Please prepare the necessary agreements, and let me know about the cancellation policy in case anything changes.  

Looking forward to working together.
