Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. We are expecting around 80 guests, and I want to ensure that the menu includes kosher options since some of our attendees observe dietary restrictions. Can you confirm if your offerings are under rabbinical supervision?  

Additionally, could you let me know if the $75 per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top? Lastly, we’re considering adding a beverage service. Could you provide information on that as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I'm pleased to confirm that our menu can be fully kosher, supervised by Rabbi Cohen, ensuring it meets all dietary laws. The $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

Regarding the beverage service, we can provide a bar option for an additional $20 per person, which includes wine and soft drinks. If you decide on the bar, we can adjust the final price accordingly.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you would like to discuss further adjustments.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. We would like to move forward with your catering services for 80 guests, including the kosher menu and the beverage service. This brings the total to $8,500, which I understand includes the additional $1,600 for the bar and excludes VAT.  

Please confirm the cancellation policy as well as the timeline for the event setup. I look forward to finalizing the details.  

Best regards,
