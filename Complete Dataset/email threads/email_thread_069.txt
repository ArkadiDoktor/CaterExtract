Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater for your gathering, which I understand is a wedding reception. Our catering services can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and we offer a diverse menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options.  

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes all necessary setup, staffing, and equipment. This price also includes VAT, so there are no hidden fees. We can provide a selection of dishes such as grilled chicken, beef brisket, and a variety of seasonal salads.  

I also wanted to mention that we can offer kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbi, ensuring that your guests' dietary needs are met. While we do not include a bar in our standard package, we can arrange beverage service separately if you would like.  

Please let me know if you need any further details or have specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit on the price. Given our budget constraints, could you consider lowering the price to $65 per person? We are expecting around 120 guests.  

Additionally, could you clarify what types of dietary accommodations you can provide for guests with allergies or special diets? It's essential for us to ensure everyone feels included at the reception.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Samantha,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to work within your budget. While I can offer a reduced price of $70 per person, I believe this will still allow us to provide quality food and service for your event.  

Regarding dietary options, we can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian meals. If you have any specific allergies in mind, please let me know, and we will do our best to address those.  

Please let me know if this pricing works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
