Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special occasion. 

We offer a variety of menu options, including mixed dishes that can accommodate different dietary needs. Our standard pricing is $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, mains, and desserts. This rate is based on a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please note that VAT is included in this pricing. 

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union and can discuss specific menu items like grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and assorted pastries. Beverages, including a bar service, can be arranged for an extra charge.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the details regarding the catering options. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to know if there's any flexibility on the per-person rate if we end up increasing our guest count. We're currently estimating around 75 guests, but this could vary. 

Also, could you clarify if the $75 includes the bar service, or is that additional? We would like a full bar to be available for our guests. 

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick response. The $75 per person is indeed for the catering alone, and the bar service would be an additional $20 per person. If you decide to increase the guest count beyond 100, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person for the catering. 

Regarding the bar, we can provide a selection of wines, beers, and signature cocktails tailored to your preferences. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details. 

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing. I would like to proceed with the catering for 75 guests at $75 per person, totaling $5,625, and we will also include the bar service at $20 per person, bringing the total to $8,625. This sounds perfect for our needs. 

Please confirm that the food will be kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision and that the VAT is included in the final price. We will also require staff for setup and service during the event. 

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can finalize everything.  

Best regards,
