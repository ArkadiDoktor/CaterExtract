Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We're expecting around 150 guests for the seminar. The pricing you mentioned sounds reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if that includes VAT or if it’s added on top. Also, can you provide more details about your kosher supervision?  

We are interested in a mixed menu, and I'd appreciate it if you could confirm whether beverages are included in that $45 price point. Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The price of $45 per person does not include VAT, which would be added to the final invoice. Our kosher meals are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet all necessary dietary requirements.  

Regarding beverages, we typically offer a separate bar package, but I can include non-alcoholic drinks for the seminar at an additional cost. If you would like, we can provide a sampling of our menu, which includes dishes like herb-crusted chicken and a seasonal vegetable platter.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can discuss the final details.  

Best,
