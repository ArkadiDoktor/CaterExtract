Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th, for which you require catering services. We specialize in providing high-quality food and service for events like yours.  

For a gathering of between 50 to 150 guests, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring all dietary preferences are accommodated. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, and this includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Please note that VAT will be added on top of the quoted price.  

We can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority, and our staff is experienced in managing dietary restrictions. Additionally, we can arrange for beverages at an additional cost.  

If you would like to proceed, we can discuss further details such as setup, staffing, and equipment. Please let me know your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided about your services. The pricing structure looks reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit, especially since our guest list might fluctuate.  

Could you confirm if you can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150? Also, I would like to know if the price per person changes for larger groups, and whether the beverages can be included in the initial quote.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I can confirm that we can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests without any issues. For larger groups, we can maintain the price of $45 per person without any increase.  

Regarding beverages, we can include a standard bar package for an additional $15 per person, which features wine, beer, and soft drinks. If you prefer, we can discuss a customized package to suit your needs.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu and other details.  

Warm regards,
