Email 1 – Food Supplier:  
Dear Sarah,  
Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event. We are excited about the opportunity to provide catering services for your team. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu, which includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure is set at £30 per person, which includes VAT.  

We can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests and will ensure that all food meets kosher requirements under the supervision of the Beth Din. Although we do not provide a bar, we can assist you in arranging beverages separately if needed.  

Please let me know the event date and any specific dietary needs, and I will be happy to suggest some representative menu items.  

Looking forward to your response.  
Best regards,  
Daniel from Gourmet Caterers

Hi Daniel,  
I appreciate your prompt reply. The event is scheduled for March 15th, and we expect around 75 attendees. It's great to hear that you can accommodate kosher needs, but I am curious if you can also provide some vegetarian options for those who prefer them.  

Additionally, could you confirm if the £30 per person includes everything, or will there be any additional costs? I would like to discuss the cancellation policy as well, just to be safe.  

Thank you,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  
Thank you for the details about your event. We can certainly include vegetarian options alongside our mixed menu to cater to all dietary preferences. Regarding pricing, the £30 per person does cover everything, including VAT, but please note that it excludes the bar services.  

Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if you cancel at least 14 days prior to the event date. I hope this addresses your concerns, and I look forward to finalizing the menu choices soon.  

Best,  
Daniel
