Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are planning a corporate gala for next month and are looking for a catering service. We specialize in upscale events and would be delighted to provide our services.  

For an event of this nature, we recommend our mixed menu featuring an array of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Our pricing starts at $65 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. We accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and can serve up to 150. All prices include VAT.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary needs or preferences, and I can tailor a menu accordingly. I look forward to discussing this further.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is scheduled for March 15th, and I appreciate the menu suggestion. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Is there flexibility in your offer, especially considering we may have closer to 120 guests? I want to ensure the food is kosher, so could you confirm the supervision details as well?  

Also, will beverages be included in your package, or are they separate?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your reply. I can offer a revised price of $60 per person for 120 guests, which would bring the total to $7,200. Our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all dietary requirements.  

As for beverages, we typically provide them separately, but I can include a limited bar package for an additional $15 per person. Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and I can prepare a detailed menu highlighting some of our signature dishes.  

Best,
