Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering services for your upcoming conference on November 15. We would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

Our standard menu includes a variety of options that can cater to both meat and dairy preferences, and we can accommodate up to 200 guests. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, mains, and desserts. We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union if that is a requirement for your attendees.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu in more detail or if you have any specific dietary needs we should consider.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the details provided. I appreciate the flexibility in menu options. We expect between 150 and 200 attendees, and I am particularly interested in the kosher offerings. Can you confirm if the $45 price includes VAT? Additionally, could you provide a few sample menu items? I would also like to know whether beverages will be included in this price or if they are separate.  

Looking forward to your clarification so we can move ahead.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person pricing does not include VAT, so it would be added on top of the total amount. As for the menu, we can offer items such as grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, a vegetarian pasta dish, and a selection of desserts including chocolate mousse and fruit tarts. Unfortunately, beverages are not included but can be provided for an additional fee if you would like.  

If you could confirm the expected number of guests, I can provide you with a final price. In terms of cancellation, we require a notice of at least seven days prior to the event.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
