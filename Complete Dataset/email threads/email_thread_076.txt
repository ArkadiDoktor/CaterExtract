Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for October 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. 

We offer a variety of menu options, including both meat and dairy selections. Our pricing is typically structured at a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes a complete buffet setup, staffing, and equipment. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and the cost includes VAT.

As we understand the importance of dietary restrictions, we are happy to provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request. Additionally, our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision to ensure compliance with dietary laws.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you need additional details.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response. The fixed price of $75 per person sounds reasonable, but we are looking to keep costs lower if possible. Would you consider adjusting the price if we go with a smaller guest count, say around 75 people? 

Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in that price or if they would be an additional charge? We are open to both options, but I want to ensure we’re on the same page.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your feedback. For a guest count of 75, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person, which would bring the total to $5,250. This includes the buffet setup and staffing, but beverages would be an additional cost. We can certainly discuss a package that includes drinks if you prefer.

Please let me know if this meets your needs, and I can send over a draft contract for your review.

Warm regards,

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for adjusting the pricing. The new rate of $70 per person works for us, and I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our needs. We will proceed with the catering for 75 guests at that price, excluding beverages for now. 

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything. We understand the cancellation policy is typically two weeks prior, which is acceptable.

Thanks again for your help.

Best,
