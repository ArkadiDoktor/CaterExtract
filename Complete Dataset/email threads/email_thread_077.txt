Hi Samuel,  

I appreciate your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I believe it would suit our guests well. However, we are expecting approximately 150 guests, and I wanted to confirm if you can accommodate that number comfortably.  

Additionally, could you please specify if the meal will be kosher and under what supervision? I want to ensure all dietary requirements are met, especially since some of our attendees strictly adhere to kosher guidelines. Lastly, does your pricing include any beverages, or would those be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your clarifications.  

Best,  
Rachel

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your questions. We can certainly accommodate 150 guests with ease. Regarding the kosher request, our meals are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet all kosher standards.  

For beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our catering package; however, we can provide a selection of wines and non-alcoholic drinks for an additional $15 per person. If you would like to proceed with this option, please let me know.  

I'm looking forward to finalizing the details with you.  

Best,  
Samuel
