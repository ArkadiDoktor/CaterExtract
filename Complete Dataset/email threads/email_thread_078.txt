Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on April 15. We would be delighted to provide a range of options to suit your needs. Our standard package includes a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, with highlights such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable platters, and a variety of desserts.  

Our pricing structure is based on a fixed cost per person, which is set at $45. This rate includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and we also offer vegetarian and gluten-free options to ensure that all dietary needs are met.  

Please note that our food is kosher and under the supervision of the Star-K. We can also provide a bar service, but this would be an additional cost.  

Let me know if you have any specific requests or if you would like to discuss this further.  

Best regards,  
David Silverman

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the menu options. I appreciate that you can cater to dietary restrictions, which is important for our guests. However, I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the pricing, as our budget is a bit tight. Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the $45 per person, or is it entirely separate?  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Rachel,  

I completely understand the need to work within a budget. While the base price is fixed at $45 per person, I can offer a slight adjustment to $40 per person if you commit to a minimum of 100 guests. The bar service would be an additional $15 per person if you choose to include it.  

Let me know if this works for you, as I would love to help make your event a success.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility on the pricing. I would like to confirm the catering for 100 guests at the adjusted price of $40 per person, totaling $4,000. Please include the bar service at $15 per person as well, bringing the final total to $5,500. I understand the cancellation policy is standard, but could you send me the details for our records?  

Looking forward to finalizing this arrangement.  

Best,
