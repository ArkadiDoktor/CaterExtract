Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with the catering. Based on the expected guest count of around 100 people, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of hors d'oeuvres, a main course, and desserts. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes VAT.  

We can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free options, ensuring that all guests have a delightful experience. Our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din, and we can provide a range of beverages, although a full bar setup would be an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision, as that is essential for our guests. However, I would like to clarify if the £45 per person includes a selection of wine or if that will be added on top of the quoted price.  

Additionally, could you confirm if the pricing remains consistent for a guest count between 80 and 120? If we go with 100 guests, will you be able to provide a few signature dishes that can highlight the event?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions and am happy to clarify. The £45 per person does not include alcoholic beverages, so we can either provide a wine package at an additional cost or allow you to arrange that separately. The pricing will remain the same within the range of 80 to 120 guests, ensuring flexibility as your plans finalize.  

As for the menu, I can propose dishes like herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable tart, and chocolate mousse cake for dessert. We will also have a dedicated team of staff for setup and service on the day of the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
