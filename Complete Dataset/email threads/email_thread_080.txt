Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your team. Our menu features a variety of options, including meat and dairy dishes, and we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free upon request.  

For pricing, we typically charge $50 per person, and this includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to a maximum of 150 guests. Our meals are kosher, supervised by the OK kosher certification, and we can provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar is not included in the standard package.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or if you have any other questions.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a few details. We expect around 120 attendees, but if we need to adjust our numbers slightly, would that be possible? Also, could you provide some examples of the menu items you offer?  

Lastly, are there options for a full bar, or would that need to be arranged separately?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can certainly accommodate a variation in guest numbers, so if you find you need to adjust the count, just let us know. For the menu, we offer dishes such as grilled chicken with roasted vegetables, beef brisket, and a delightful selection of gourmet salads.  

As for the bar, we can offer a basic beverage package; however, a full bar service would need to be arranged separately at an additional cost. The total for 120 guests would amount to $6,000, inclusive of VAT, with the same dietary accommodations available.  

Let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
