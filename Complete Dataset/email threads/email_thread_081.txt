Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. We specialize in offering a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person for a mixed menu, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We require a minimum of 100 guests, and we can accommodate up to 200 guests. All prices include VAT. We also offer a kosher catering option supervised by the Orthodox Union, should that be a requirement for your event.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu options further or have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I was hoping we could explore a few more details. I noticed you mentioned a mixed menu; can you provide some examples of the main courses? Also, we are expecting around 150 guests, so I’d like to confirm the final price based on that number.  

Furthermore, could you clarify if beverages are included in the package? I want to ensure we cater to all our guests' preferences, including those who may want kosher options.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For the mixed menu, we typically offer dishes like grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, beef brisket, and a vegetarian lasagna. Based on 150 guests, the total price would be $7,500, which includes VAT.  

Beverages are not included in that price, but we can provide a beverage package that includes soft drinks and a selection of wines at an additional cost. If you decide to go with our kosher option, we can ensure that all beverages adhere to those standards as well.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can discuss the next steps.  

Best,  
Mark
