Dear Emma,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in creating a memorable dining experience for your special day.  

Our typical pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which varies depending on the menu selections you choose. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and offer a range of menu options, including meat and dairy dishes. If you prefer kosher meals, we can provide options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council.  

Please let us know if you would like to include beverages, as this can affect the overall pricing. We are also able to accommodate dietary restrictions, so please share any specific needs your guests may have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting around 100 guests, and I'm particularly interested in your mixed menu options. Could you provide me with more details on the pricing per person and if you include VAT in your total? Additionally, it would be great to know if the bar services are included or if that would be an extra cost.  

I appreciate your flexibility with dietary accommodations. We will have a few guests with specific needs, and I will confirm those shortly.  

Best,  
Emma

Dear Emma,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For a mixed menu, our pricing is typically around 65 dollars per person, and this includes VAT. For the bar, we can offer a package that includes wine, beer, and soft drinks for an additional 15 dollars per person.  

Also, we can provide a selection of dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a variety of vegetarian options. If you confirm 100 guests, the total with the bar package would be 8,000 dollars. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed to finalize the details.  

Best,
