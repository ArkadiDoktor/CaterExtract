Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Bites for your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to our clients' needs.  

For this particular event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of dishes, including grilled chicken, vegetarian pasta, and a selection of seasonal salads. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $45, which would include the meal and all necessary setup. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests, and we ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

Please note that our prices include VAT, but beverages will be an additional charge. We can provide a full bar service at an extra cost if you are interested. Additionally, we can cater to various dietary restrictions, so please let us know if there are specific needs.  

I look forward to discussing this further and helping make your event a success.  

Best regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed menu options. The mixed menu sounds perfect for our corporate event. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of things. While the per-person rate is reasonable, our budget is a bit tighter than anticipated. Would you be able to adjust the price to $40 per person?  

Additionally, could you confirm the types of beverages included and whether we could add some non-alcoholic options as well? We expect around 100 guests.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the need to stay within budget. I can offer the mixed menu at $40 per person for your event, which would bring the total to $4,000 for 100 guests. This price still includes VAT.  

Regarding beverages, we typically offer a selection of wines and beers for our bar service, but we can certainly include a range of non-alcoholic options as well at no extra charge. As for the setup, we will provide all necessary equipment and staffing for the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed to finalize the details.  

Best,
