Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed pricing information. I appreciate the kosher certification and the dietary options you offer. However, given our budget constraints, would you be open to adjusting the price to $65 per guest? Additionally, could you confirm whether the bar service can be included at that rate?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of staying within budget. I can adjust the price to $70 per guest, which would still allow us to provide a high-quality experience. Unfortunately, bar service would need to be priced separately, typically around $15 per guest for a limited selection.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Warm regards,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your flexibility in pricing. I'm happy to confirm our agreement at $70 per guest for the catering services. I understand that bar services will be an additional cost, which we will manage separately. We are expecting approximately 100 guests, making the total around $7,000, including VAT.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience, and let’s discuss the next steps regarding setup and timing for the event.  

Thank you!
