Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Klein, and I am with Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to provide catering services for your event.  

We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring that we can accommodate diverse dietary preferences. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, and this includes setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. We generally cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can comfortably serve up to 200.  

I would like to confirm whether you require kosher food, as we can provide meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Additionally, please let me know if you would like to include a bar service, as that can be arranged separately.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
David Klein

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The corporate gala will indeed require kosher catering. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate that under Orthodox Union supervision.  

Regarding the pricing, I was hoping to negotiate a bit. Would you be able to offer a slightly lower rate, perhaps closer to $40 per person? Also, could you clarify whether the $45 includes VAT or if that will be added on top of the total?  

We expect around 150 guests, and I would like to know what menu highlights you recommend for a mixed offering. If you could provide some examples of dishes, that would be great as well.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I can accommodate the price of $40 per person, and this will include VAT in the final quote. For a mixed menu, I recommend dishes such as chicken marsala, herb-crusted salmon, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

Regarding dietary options, we can also provide vegetarian and gluten-free choices. Please keep in mind that our cancellation policy is 14 days prior to the event date.  

If this works for you, I can prepare a formal quote for 150 guests at a total of $6,000. Please let me know if you would like to proceed.
