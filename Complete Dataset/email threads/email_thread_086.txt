Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you are organizing a corporate retreat for your team on March 15th at the Riverside Conference Center, and I would love to assist you with catering. We specialize in providing high-quality meals that fit a variety of dietary needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and seasonal salads. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes everything from setup to service. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our prices include VAT.  

Additionally, our meals are kosher, supervised by the local Orthodox rabbi, ensuring all dietary laws are followed. Please let me know if you would like to include a beverage package or if you have any specific dietary restrictions to consider.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the quick response and the proposal. The menu sounds great, and the pricing is within our budget. I wanted to clarify if the $45 per person covers a full meal including beverages or if that would be an additional charge. Also, we might have a few guests with gluten-free needs. Can you accommodate that?  

Lastly, I would appreciate it if you could send over the cancellation terms before we proceed.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. The $45 per person does not include a beverage package, which we can offer for an additional $15 per person. We can definitely accommodate gluten-free options, such as quinoa salads and gluten-free pasta dishes.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require at least a week's notice for any changes or cancellations, which allows us to manage our resources efficiently. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I would like to move forward with the catering as proposed, including the gluten-free options but excluding the beverage package. The total for 100 guests comes to $4,500, which works for us. Please proceed with the formal agreement.  

Looking forward to finalizing everything soon.
