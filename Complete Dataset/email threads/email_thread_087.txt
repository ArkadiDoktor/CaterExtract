Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing to follow up on our recent conversation regarding the catering for your charity gala scheduled for April 15th. We would be thrilled to provide our services for this significant occasion.  

Our standard catering package is priced at $45 per person, which includes a variety of dishes tailored to suit your guests. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 attendees, with a menu that features both meat and vegetarian options. All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that they meet all dietary requirements.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages as part of our package, or if you prefer, we can discuss options for a full bar. Please let me know your preferences, and I can adjust the proposal accordingly.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your detailed proposal. The pricing looks reasonable, but I’d like to clarify a few things. Are the VAT and service fees included in the $45 per person rate? We also need to keep our guest count flexible, so can you accommodate 75 guests if necessary?  

Regarding the menu, could you provide some specific dish options? Additionally, if we opt for the full bar, what would the extra cost be?  

Thanks for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person rate does not include VAT; we add that on top of the total. For the guest count, we can certainly adjust to accommodate a minimum of 75 guests and a maximum of 150.  

As for the menu, I suggest including dishes like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of salads. If you choose the full bar option, it would be an additional $15 per person.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare a revised proposal.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the clarification. After considering everything, I would like to proceed with your catering services for 100 guests, including the full bar option. The total will be $6,000, including VAT, correct? Please confirm the cancellation policy so we can finalize our agreement.  

Looking forward to your reply.
