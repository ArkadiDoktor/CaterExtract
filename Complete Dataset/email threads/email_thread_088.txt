Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The menu sounds great! However, we’re anticipating around 75 guests and would prefer to keep the budget in line with our previous events. Is there any flexibility in pricing if we increase the guest count to 100? Additionally, could you confirm if the food is kosher and under what supervision? We also need to know whether beverages and a bar are included in the package.

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. If you increase the guest count to 100, we can maintain the same per-person rate of £45, resulting in a total of £4,500. As for the kosher aspect, our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din. However, beverages and bar service would be an additional cost, typically around £1,500 for a full bar setup. 

Please let me know if this works for you, or if you would like to discuss other options.  

Best regards,
