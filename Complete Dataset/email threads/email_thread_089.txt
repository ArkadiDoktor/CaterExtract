Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss your catering needs for the corporate gala scheduled on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food and service for events like yours.   

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, all of which can be prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union. Our pricing structure is set at $65 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. The price covers a three-course meal, including appetizers, a main course, and desserts.   

Please let me know your specific requirements, and I would be happy to provide you with a sample menu and any additional details you need.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but I would like to know if we can adjust the price per person to better fit our budget. We are looking at approximately 100 guests, so I would appreciate any flexibility you might be able to offer on the total cost. Additionally, does the package include beverages, or would there be a separate charge for that?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. Given your request, I can offer a revised price of $60 per person for 100 guests, which still includes VAT. However, the beverage service would be an additional $15 per person if you would like a bar setup.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, and we can finalize the details. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event date.   

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility on the pricing. I’m pleased to confirm the catering for 100 guests at $60 per person, and I would like to include the bar for an additional $15 per person. This brings the total to $7,500, and I understand that VAT is included in this price.  

Please go ahead and prepare the necessary documents for us to finalize the agreement. I appreciate the excellent service and look forward to working with you on this event.  

Best regards,
