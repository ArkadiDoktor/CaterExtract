Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering services for your upcoming wedding reception on March 15, 2024. We specialize in providing high-quality food tailored to events like yours. Our typical menu includes a range of options, from savory meat dishes to delightful vegetarian selections.  

For a wedding of this nature, we usually recommend a package priced at approximately $75 per person, which includes three courses and a selection of beverages. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and all our meals are prepared under strict rabbinical supervision, ensuring they are kosher.  

Please let me know if you have specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I can provide you with a tailored menu suited to your guests. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, but I was hoping to discuss the pricing. Since we might have closer to 120 guests, would you be able to offer a fixed price for that number? Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 includes VAT?  

I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your inquiry about the pricing. For 120 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $8,500, which includes VAT. This price covers the complete package of appetizers, main courses, dessert, and drinks for the event.  

Please note that we can provide alternatives for any dietary restrictions you may have. If you require a bar setup, we can arrange that for an additional fee. Let me know how you would like to proceed, and we can finalize the details.
