For your event, we offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests, and we also provide dietary accommodations for vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

In addition, our service includes setup and staffing for the event, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Please let me know if you would like to schedule a tasting or discuss any specific preferences you might have.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, our budget is a bit tighter than expected, and I was wondering if there is any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we were to confirm a larger number of guests.  

Moreover, could you clarify whether beverages are included in the $75 price? We would also like to know about the cancellation policy, just in case there are any changes.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand the need to stay within budget. I can offer a rate of $70 per person if you confirm for 100 guests or more, which would allow us to provide a comprehensive selection while accommodating your budget constraints.  

Regarding beverages, our initial proposal does not include a bar, but we can discuss options if you would like to provide drinks for your guests. As for the cancellation policy, we require notice at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Thank you for the revised offer and for clarifying the details regarding beverages and cancellation. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the $70 per person rate for 100 guests, totaling $7,000, which fits perfectly within our budget. That includes the kosher menu options we discussed, correct?  

Please confirm this arrangement, and we will move forward with the planning.
