Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on December 15th. We would be thrilled to cater this event for you. Our standard offering includes a delightful mixed menu that features a variety of meat and dairy options, suitable for diverse palates.  

For your event, we can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests. Our pricing is structured at £40 per person, which includes VAT. The menu can be customized to include dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of gourmet salads. We also offer dietary accommodations for vegetarian and gluten-free guests.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any specific preferences or requirements.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to confirm that the food will be kosher, as we have a significant number of attendees who require it. Could you tell me more about the supervision under which the food is prepared?  

Additionally, I am considering a bar service for the event. Is that something you can provide, or is it excluded from your catering package? Lastly, could we possibly look at a price range if we decide to increase the guest count to 200?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. Yes, all our food is kosher, prepared under the supervision of the London Beth Din. We can certainly provide a bar service, which would be an additional £15 per person.  

Regarding your request for accommodating 200 guests, we can adjust the price to £38 per person if you confirm a minimum of 150. The final price would then be £7,600, which includes VAT. I can also confirm that we have the capacity to handle dietary restrictions as needed.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal.  

Best,

Thank you for clarifying the details. I am happy to proceed with your proposal for 150 guests at the agreed price of £5,700, which includes the bar service. Please send over the contract, and I would like to confirm that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we cancel at least two weeks in advance.  

Looking forward to working together to make this event a success.
