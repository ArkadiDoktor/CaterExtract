Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist in creating a memorable dining experience for your guests. 

We offer a diverse menu that includes options for meat, dairy, and pareve dishes, ensuring that we can accommodate various dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. 

Please note that all our food is kosher and supervised by the local Kashrut authority. Additionally, we do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can discuss beverage options separately if you're interested. Our pricing includes VAT, so you won’t have any surprises there. 

Once I hear back from you, I can provide a sample menu to give you an idea of our offerings. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and detailed information. We're excited about the possibility of partnering with Gourmet Catering Solutions. The menu options sound appealing, but I wanted to confirm a few details before moving forward. 

Could you provide clarity on any dietary accommodations available? We have a few guests with specific allergies, and it’s important we address those. Also, if we were to increase the guest count to 250, would the price per person remain the same? Lastly, could you send over a sample menu at your earliest convenience? 

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest and the questions you raised. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, as long as we are informed in advance. Regarding the guest count, the fixed price of $75 per person remains valid up to 200 guests. For 250 guests, we can offer a slightly reduced rate of $70 per person. 

I will prepare a sample menu and send that over shortly. Just to confirm, our cancellation policy requires notice at least two weeks prior to the event date for a full refund. 

Please let me know if there’s anything else you would like to discuss.  

Best wishes,
