Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate conference scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our team specializes in providing high-quality meals for various events, ensuring all dietary requirements are met.  

Based on your expected guest count of 100, we offer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options. Our pricing is set at £30 per person, which is inclusive of VAT. We can certainly accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options if necessary. Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, but please note that alcohol will be excluded unless specified.  

I’d be happy to discuss the details further and tailor a menu that fits your needs. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the initial proposal. I appreciate the inclusion of the vegetarian and gluten-free options in your mixed menu. However, I would like to clarify the beverage situation. Are you able to offer a bar service as well?  

Additionally, could we discuss the possibility of a slight reduction in the price per person to £28, considering we might be hosting between 80 to 120 guests? It would be great to get a clearer idea of the final price based on our minimum and maximum guest estimates.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. I can confirm that we can include a bar service, but that would require an adjustment in the overall pricing. Regarding your proposed price of £28 per person, I can accommodate that if you can guarantee a minimum of 100 guests. This would bring the total to £2,800, which does include VAT.  

We will provide a variety of dishes, such as roasted chicken with seasonal vegetables and a creamy pasta primavera, alongside salads and desserts. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks in advance. Please let me know if this arrangement works for you.  

Best wishes,
