Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to learn about the wedding you are organizing on June 15th at the Grand Hall. We at Culinary Delights specialize in catering for weddings and would love to provide our services for your special day.  

Our catering packages start at $85 per person, and we can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests. Our menu is fully kosher, supervised by the OU, and we offer a mixed selection of dishes, including meat and dairy options. We can also provide vegetarian and gluten-free accommodations upon request.  

As for beverages, our standard package does not include a bar, but we can arrange for beverage service if you desire. Additionally, all prices include VAT, so there won't be any surprises on your final invoice.  

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a tasting or discuss the menu options further.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The wedding is indeed an exciting event for us. The proposed price of $85 per person is a bit above our initial budget. Would it be possible to discuss a price adjustment or perhaps a more simplified menu? We are expecting around 150 guests, and we would love to keep things within a range of $70 to $80 per person.  

Also, could you clarify what dishes would be included in the package? That would help us in our decision-making process.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the need to stick to your budget. We can adjust the menu to fit within your desired price range of $70 to $80 per person. I can propose a selection that includes our popular roasted chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a choice of starch, along with a salad bar.  

For the 150 guests, the adjusted price would be $75 per person, which would include VAT. If you decide to proceed, I can also arrange for a beverage package at an additional cost. Please let me know how you would like to move forward, and I can provide more details on the menu options.  

Best,  
Michael

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility with the menu and the adjusted pricing. I appreciate the proposed dishes and the inclusion of VAT in your quote. I would like to confirm the catering for 150 guests at $75 per person, totaling $11,250. Please note that we will require the setup to be completed two hours before the event starts, and we would like the food service to last for four hours.  

Could you also send over the cancellation policy and any other details we need to be aware of? Looking forward to finalizing this.  

Best regards,  
Sarah
