Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala on December 15th at the City Hall. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Based on your anticipated guest list, we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options, ensuring there’s something for everyone.  

Our pricing structure is set at £50 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and can cater up to 200 guests if needed. Additionally, we offer a selection of beverages, though the bar services will be an extra cost. Our dishes are prepared under strict supervision to ensure they are kosher, specifically under the supervision of the London Beth Din.  

Please let us know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or have any dietary requirements we should consider.

Hi Martin,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The price per person sounds reasonable, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the total cost, especially if we reach closer to the maximum of 200 guests. Also, could you provide a brief overview of some of the menu highlights? We will have a few guests with dietary restrictions, so I’d like to understand how you can accommodate that.  

Lastly, do your cancellation terms allow for any adjustments if we need to change the guest count last minute?  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

I appreciate your follow-up. If we reach the maximum of 200 guests, we can offer a final price of £48 per person. As for the menu, we can include options such as beef brisket, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice period of two weeks before the event for any significant changes without a fee. However, we can be flexible if minor adjustments are needed closer to the date.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.
