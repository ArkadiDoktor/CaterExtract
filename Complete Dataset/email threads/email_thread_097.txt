Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Emily,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your catering needs for the wedding you are organizing on February 25th at the Grand Ballroom. We specialize in providing high-quality food services and would love to be part of this special occasion.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which covers a complete meal including starters, mains, and dessert. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and I want to confirm that our food is kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din.  

Please let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss menu options and any other requirements you might have.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed information about your services. Our wedding will likely have around 100 guests, so your proposal sounds promising. However, I wanted to clarify if the £45 per person includes VAT and whether beverages are part of the package. Additionally, we are considering some dietary accommodations for a few guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Emily Carter

Hi Emily,  

Thanks for your follow-up. The £45 per person does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total cost. As for beverages, we do not include a bar in that price, but we can certainly offer a beverage package if you are interested. We are happy to accommodate dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with these adjustments, and I can draft a more tailored proposal for you.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for clarifying everything. After considering the details, I would like to move forward with your catering services. Please include the beverage package in your final proposal. I appreciate the dietary accommodations as well. With VAT, the final price for 100 guests will come to £5,400.  

Let me know the next steps to finalize our agreement.  

Warm regards,
