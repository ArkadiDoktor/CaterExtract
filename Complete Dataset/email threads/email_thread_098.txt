Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Greenberg, and I represent Green Caterers. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15 and are looking for catering services. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events like yours, and I would love to discuss how we can assist you.  

Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $80 per person, depending on your menu choices and dietary requirements. We can offer a mixed menu, including both meat and dairy options, and we can accommodate various dietary needs. Additionally, we ensure that our dishes are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know the expected number of guests, and if you would like to include a beverage service in your package. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
David Greenberg

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are planning for about 150 guests, with a mix of dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. I appreciate the range you provided, but could you confirm if that price includes VAT and whether your service includes beverages? I'm also interested in knowing your cancellation terms.  

We aim to finalize the catering arrangements by the end of this week, so any additional information you could provide would be helpful.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. For 150 guests, we can offer a fixed price of $65 per person, which does include VAT. Our package does not typically cover beverages, but we can add a bar service for an additional fee.  

As for cancellation, we have a policy of requiring notice 14 days before the event for a full refund. I hope this helps clarify things, and I can provide a sample menu that includes dishes like herb-crusted chicken and a variety of vegetarian options. Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any further questions.  

Warm regards,
