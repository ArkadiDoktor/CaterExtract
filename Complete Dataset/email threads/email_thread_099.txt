Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with a delicious menu tailored to your needs.  

We specialize in providing a mixed menu, which can include both meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Our pricing typically ranges from $30 to $50 per person, depending on the specific selections you choose. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests for this event.  

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards. We can also provide a variety of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to set up a time to discuss the menu in more detail or if you have any immediate questions.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the quick response and the information provided. I appreciate the kosher supervision details; that is important for our team.  

Could you clarify if the prices you mentioned include VAT? Additionally, we are considering a bar service for the event and would like to know if that can be included in the package or if it would be an additional cost.  

Let’s aim for around 100 guests, and we’d like to finalize the menu as soon as possible to ensure we stay within our budget.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Samantha,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. To clarify, the pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the quoted amounts. Regarding the bar service, we can offer a selection of beverages for an additional $15 per person. This can include soft drinks, wine, and beer, tailored to your preferences.  

If we proceed with 100 guests, the total cost would be $4,500, including the menu and basic service but excluding the bar. We can provide a detailed menu with highlights like grilled salmon, roasted vegetables, and assorted desserts once we finalize the guest count and any dietary restrictions.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any other questions.  

Warm regards,
