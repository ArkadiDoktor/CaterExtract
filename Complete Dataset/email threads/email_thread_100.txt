Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights Catering regarding your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher catering services, and I would love to discuss how we can support your event.  

Our pricing typically ranges from $45 to $60 per person, depending on the menu selections. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards for your attendees.  

I would be happy to provide a sample menu that includes a variety of options, such as grilled salmon, chicken primavera, and a selection of salads and sides. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages and if you have any dietary restrictions to consider.  

Looking forward to your response,  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The menu sounds enticing, and I would like to see the full menu options you mentioned.  

Regarding the pricing, if we have 100 guests, could you confirm if the $60 price point includes VAT? We are also considering whether to include a bar service for the event. If we decide to go with beverages, how would that affect the total price?  

Looking forward to your clarifications.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $60 price does include VAT, so there would be no additional charges for taxes. If you decide to include a bar service, we can offer a selection of wines and spirits for an additional $15 per person. This would bring the total to $75 per person for 100 guests, which amounts to $7,500.  

In terms of dietary options, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free meals upon request. I will send over the complete menu shortly, including our popular dishes such as beef brisket and roasted vegetable platters.  

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you're ready to proceed.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarification on the pricing structure and VAT. After discussing with my team, we are excited to move forward with the catering for 100 guests, including the bar service. That brings our total to $7,500, which we find acceptable.  

Please send over the menu options as soon as possible so we can finalize the details. Additionally, I would like to confirm your cancellation policy before we proceed.  

Thanks again for your assistance.
