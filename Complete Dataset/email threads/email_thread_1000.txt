Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to confirm that we will need kosher meals for our event. Can you let me know if your offerings are under rabbinical supervision, and if so, which authority? Additionally, we would like to have some beverages included. 

If we proceed, we expect around 150 attendees, and I would like to discuss any flexibility in the pricing as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your clarification. Our meals are indeed kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring compliance with all dietary laws. I can also include a beverage package for an additional $10 per person, which covers soft drinks and juices. 

Regarding the pricing, I can offer a reduced rate of $42 per person if you confirm your booking by the end of the week. Please let me know if that works for you, and I can prepare a formal proposal.  

Best,
