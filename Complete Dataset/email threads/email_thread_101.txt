Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our pricing typically starts at $75 per person, which includes a variety of options tailored to your guests' needs.  

We offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, and all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please let me know how many guests you expect, as we can accommodate between 50 and 150 attendees.  

We can also provide beverage services for an additional fee. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to two weeks before the event.  

I look forward to your response so we can finalize the details.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are currently planning for approximately 100 guests and would like to have a mix of meat and dairy options. Could you provide a more detailed menu? Also, we are considering adding a bar service, so please share the pricing for that as well.  

Lastly, could you confirm if the $75 price per person includes VAT?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The price of $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final amount. For a bar service, we offer packages starting at $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and beers.  

Regarding the menu, we can offer dishes such as roasted chicken, brisket, grilled vegetables, and an assortment of dairy-based desserts. We are also happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian options. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the details. Everything sounds great, and I’d like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests, including the bar service. This brings the total to $9,000, which I understand includes the food and the bar, but not VAT. Please confirm that the total is $9,000 excluding VAT, and let’s finalize this agreement.  

I appreciate your help, and I’m looking forward to a successful event.  

Best regards,
