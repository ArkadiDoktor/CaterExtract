Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming event on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services, and I would be delighted to help make your event a memorable one.  

For a gathering of this nature, I suggest a mixed menu that includes a selection of meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at £45 per person, which covers a full meal, including appetizers, mains, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests, and I can assure you that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Westminster Rabbinical Council.  

As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can certainly arrange for a drinks service if desired. Please let me know any specific dietary requirements you may have, as we are equipped to handle various accommodations.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a couple of details before proceeding. Given our expected guest count, could we negotiate the price down to £40 per person? Additionally, is VAT included in the quoted price?  

I appreciate your assurance on dietary accommodations. We will have a few guests with specific dietary needs, so knowing that flexibility is available is reassuring.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can agree to the price of £40 per person for your event, and I confirm that this price does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

Regarding dietary needs, we can certainly cater to specific requests, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Please provide me with the details of those requirements when you can.  

As for the bar services, we can offer a separate package for drinks if you decide to add that on. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for accommodating the price adjustment. I would like to move forward with the catering at £40 per person for 75 guests. Please note that VAT will be added accordingly. Additionally, we will require vegetarian options for about ten guests.  

I appreciate your flexibility regarding the bar service, but we will handle beverages separately. Could you also confirm the cancellation policy? It’s important for us to know our options just in case.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details.  

Best regards,
