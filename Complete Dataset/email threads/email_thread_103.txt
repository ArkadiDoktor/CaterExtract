Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your corporate gathering. We specialize in a variety of menu options, including meat and dairy dishes, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, inclusive of VAT, with a minimum guest count of 50 and a maximum of 150. For your event, we can suggest a mixed menu featuring items such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

Please let us know if you would like us to include beverages or if you have any specific dietary requirements we should accommodate. We can also discuss setup and staffing details.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The menu sounds wonderful, but I wanted to clarify a couple of things. Could you let me know if the $75 per person covers everything, including the bar, or if that’s an additional cost? We are expecting around 80 guests, so the total would be around $6,000, correct? Also, can you confirm if the dishes are fully kosher and under which supervision?  

We would like to ensure that there are options for guests with dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free and vegetarian choices.  

Thanks for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The $75 per person does not include beverages; we can provide a bar service at an additional $15 per person if you'd like. Your calculation for 80 guests is accurate, bringing the total to $6,000.  

All of our dishes are fully kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian options as requested.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this proposal, and we can finalize the details, including setup and staffing.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying everything. I would like to proceed with the catering for 80 guests, including the bar service, bringing the total to $7,200. Please ensure that the setup includes all necessary equipment and staffing as discussed. I understand the cancellation policy is flexible up until two weeks before the event, which works for us.  

Let’s move forward with this arrangement. Please send over the contract when you can.
