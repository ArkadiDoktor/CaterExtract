Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate event on December 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to various occasions, and I would be thrilled to assist you.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Our pricing is structured at £45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. Please note that our prices do include VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the London Beth Din. If you are interested, we can also discuss beverage arrangements separately.  

Let me know your thoughts, and if you have any specific preferences or dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing you provided seems reasonable, but I would appreciate it if we could explore a slightly lower price per person, perhaps closer to £40, especially considering we may have around 100 guests.  

Also, could you confirm if the dessert options can include gluten-free selections? I want to ensure we cater to everyone's needs. Regarding the beverages, I would like to know if you can include a bar service within the package or if that would be an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your position. I can adjust the price to £42 per person for the 100 guests, which will still allow us to provide an excellent selection of dishes. As for the dessert options, we can definitely include gluten-free choices to accommodate dietary requirements.  

Regarding the bar service, we can offer a package that includes a selection of wines and soft drinks at an additional cost of £15 per person. Please let me know if that works for you, and I can finalize the details.  

I look forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your adjustments. I am happy to accept your offer of £42 per person for the catering, including gluten-free dessert options. However, I will need to exclude the bar service for now due to budget constraints.  

Please confirm that the final price will be £4,200 for 100 guests and that it includes VAT. I would also like to understand your cancellation policy before we finalize everything.  

Thanks for your assistance, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
