Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for March 15, 2024. We specialize in creating memorable culinary experiences and would love to cater for your event.  

For a gathering of between 50 to 150 guests, we offer a range of catering packages, starting at $45 per person. This includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and desserts. I would like to confirm that our menu can be fully kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all dietary requirements.  

We can include a beverage package, featuring soft drinks and water, but please note that alcoholic beverages can be arranged at an additional cost. Our menu typically consists of a mixed selection, accommodating various dietary needs.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or require any specific dietary accommodations. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding the catering options. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a couple of points before we proceed. Can you confirm if the $45 per person includes VAT, and is there any flexibility in the menu pricing if we decide on 75 guests? Additionally, could you provide some examples of the main courses you would suggest?  

I appreciate your help in making this event special.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up questions. The $45 per person pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final bill. For your gathering of 75 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $3,300, which includes setup and staff.  

As for the main courses, I recommend our herb-marinated roast chicken, grilled salmon with dill sauce, or a hearty vegetable lasagna for vegetarian guests. We can certainly accommodate any specific dietary needs as well.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and if you’d like to finalize the details.  

Best regards,
