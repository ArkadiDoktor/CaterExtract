Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to confirm our availability for catering your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We specialize in providing diverse menu options, and I believe we can create a package that suits your needs.  

Our pricing typically ranges from 30 to 50 dollars per person, depending on the selected menu items. We offer various dietary accommodations, including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options, ensuring we can cater to all attendees. Our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Rabbinical Council, and we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes.  

Please let me know the expected number of guests, as we usually require a minimum of 50 and can accommodate up to 200. Additionally, we can discuss beverage options, as we have a separate bar service if you're interested.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The retreat is definitely an important event for us, and we're expecting around 120 guests. I appreciate the flexibility with the menu and the dietary accommodations you mentioned.  

However, I noticed that the price per person seems a bit steep for our budget. Would you be able to offer a fixed price for the entire event? We’d also prefer to keep the focus on a meat menu for this occasion. Please confirm if VAT is included in your pricing or if it will be added on top.  

Looking forward to your revised proposal.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and for providing the guest count. I can offer a fixed price of $4,200 for the event, which includes a full meat menu for 120 guests. This price does include VAT, so there won’t be any additional charges.  

We can work on a menu that includes popular items such as grilled chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of sides. The bar service would be an additional cost, though we can provide soft drinks and water as part of the package.  

Please let me know if this meets your expectations, and I can prepare the necessary details.  

Best,
