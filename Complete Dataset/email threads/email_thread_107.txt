Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for February 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services and would be delighted to assist with your event.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes options for both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing starts at $30 per person, which includes a full buffet, service staff, and all necessary equipment. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests comfortably.  

Please note that our pricing does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. We also offer kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. Could you please confirm if you require any specific dietary accommodations?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the proposal details. I appreciate the mixed menu option and the inclusion of kosher food supervision. I would like to confirm that we’ll need vegan options as well to accommodate some of our attendees.  

Regarding the pricing, could you provide me with a clearer breakdown? Ideally, I’d like to know if there’s any flexibility to lower the per-person cost, especially if our guest count approaches the upper limit of 150. Also, will beverages be included in the $30 per person rate?  

Thanks again for your assistance.

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your interest in our services. I can certainly include additional vegan options in the menu for your guests. As for the pricing, if you can confirm a final headcount closer to 150 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $28 per person. Please also note that beverages would be an additional charge, typically around $10 per person, depending on the selections chosen.  

Our cancellation policy is straightforward: a full refund is available if cancellation occurs at least two weeks before the event. Otherwise, we retain a 30% deposit. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.
