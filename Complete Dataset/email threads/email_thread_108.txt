Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming event on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your corporate gala. Our team specializes in a variety of menu options, including kosher meals under strict supervision, perfect for accommodating your diverse guests.  

For a guest count between 50 and 150, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes VAT. This pricing provides a mixed menu featuring dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. Please note that beverages are not included in this package, but we can arrange a bar service as an add-on.  

Let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I would be happy to assist further.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thanks for your prompt reply and for the detailed proposal. The menu options sound fantastic. However, I was hoping to clarify a couple of things. First, could you confirm whether the $45 per person includes any specific dietary accommodations? Additionally, we might have closer to 120 guests, so I would like to know if there’s any flexibility on pricing if we go above that number.  

I appreciate your help as we finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, we can certainly accommodate special dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, without any additional cost. If your guest count reaches 120, we can maintain the same price of $45 per person, but for groups larger than that, we can offer a discount, bringing the price down to $42 per person for every guest over 150.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I can prepare the final agreement shortly.  

Warm regards,
