Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your catering needs. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for events, and I would love to assist you with your upcoming wedding reception on May 15th.  

We offer a range of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes that can accommodate various dietary preferences. Our pricing starts at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150.  

Additionally, we can provide a fully stocked bar for an extra fee, or you may choose to handle beverages separately. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but I would like to clarify a couple of points. Are there options for vegetarian and gluten-free dishes available? Also, would it be possible to negotiate the price if our guest count ends up being closer to 75?  

I appreciate the inclusion of VAT in your pricing, but I would like to ensure that the price is final and that there are no hidden fees. The bar option also sounds great, but let’s discuss that further once we nail down the food menu.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. We do offer a variety of vegetarian and gluten-free options, ensuring that all dietary accommodations are met. Regarding the guest count, I can offer a price of £42 per person for a group of 75, which still includes VAT.  

In terms of the bar, we can provide a selection of beers and wines at an additional cost of £15 per person, or you can choose to manage that aspect independently.  

Let me know if this pricing works for you or if you would like to explore other options.  

Best wishes,  
James

Hi James,  

Thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility on the price and the confirmation of dietary options. I would like to proceed with the catering for 75 guests at £42 per person, which brings the total to £3,150. Please confirm that this includes VAT and that the menu will adhere to kosher standards as previously discussed.  

Once you confirm, I will send over a deposit to secure our booking. Please also provide details on your cancellation policy.  

Looking forward to finalizing this.  

Best regards,  
Sarah
