Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to explore the possibility of reducing the cost a bit, especially since we are expecting around 100 guests. Could we possibly negotiate the per-person price to $40?  

Additionally, could you clarify if your bar service is included in this pricing? We may require a beverage selection, depending on the final menu.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. We can indeed adjust the per-person price to $40 for the 100 guests you mentioned. However, I must clarify that our bar service is an additional cost and not included in the base pricing. We can provide a selection of wines and soft drinks for an extra $15 per person.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can provide a more detailed menu for your approval.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility on the pricing. I am happy to accept your proposal at $40 per person for 100 guests, bringing the total to $4,000. Please include the bar service for an additional $15 per person, which will bring our final total to $5,500.  

I would like to proceed with the kosher menu and ensure that all dietary accommodations are met. Please send over the final contract and any necessary details regarding setup and staffing as soon as you can.  

Looking forward to making this event a success!
