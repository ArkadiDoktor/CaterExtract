Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. We have extensive experience in catering events of this nature and would love to help make your evening a success.  

Our pricing structure is generally set at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 300 guests, and I would be happy to provide a customized menu based on your preferences. All our food is kosher and under the supervision of the local rabbi.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific dietary requirements to consider.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify if the $50 per person includes VAT or if that would be added on top. Additionally, while I understand the menu can be customized, I would like to ensure that we have options for both meat and vegetarian dishes to cater to all our guests.  

Could you also provide information on the setup? Will your team handle all the equipment and staffing needed for the event?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $50 per person pricing does not include VAT, which would be an additional 20%. I can certainly provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options to accommodate all dietary preferences.  

Our team will take care of all setup, including necessary equipment and staffing for the event. We typically recommend serving a variety of dishes, such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of desserts.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

Could you please send over the contract? I also want to confirm the cancellation policy in case we need to make any adjustments as the date approaches.
