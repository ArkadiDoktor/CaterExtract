Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I wanted to confirm if the $75 per person price includes VAT, as that will affect our overall budget. Additionally, we are aiming for around 100 guests, but we may need to adjust this number.  

Could you also clarify if the food will be kosher and the supervision details? We would prefer a menu that includes a variety of options for our diverse group. If possible, could you suggest a few dishes from your menu?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $75 per person price does include VAT, which should help with your budgeting. As for the kosher requirements, we can provide meals that are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For your menu, I would recommend items such as grilled chicken with garlic mashed potatoes, a vegetarian lasagna, and a seasonal salad. We can certainly accommodate a variety of dietary preferences, including vegan and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further adjustments in mind.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. Everything looks great, and I would like to confirm the catering for 100 guests at the price of $7,500, which includes VAT. Please ensure the menu features the grilled chicken and vegetarian lasagna, as discussed.  

Additionally, we do not require a bar service, but we will need the setup and staffing to be arranged. Our cancellation policy should ideally be flexible in case of any changes. Looking forward to working with you on this.  

Best,
