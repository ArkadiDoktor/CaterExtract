Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. We specialize in mixed cuisine menus and can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing starts at £45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and dessert. We typically cater for a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 200 guests. I can confirm that our food is kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din.  

As for beverages, we offer a separate bar package if you're interested, but it is not included in the meal price. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further, and I can provide specific menu highlights as well.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but with a guest list that could reach around 180, I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in your pricing structure for larger groups. Additionally, could you clarify if the £45 per person price includes VAT, or if it would be added on top?  

I’m also curious about the menu options you mentioned. Could you share a few specific dishes that would be included? Finally, we would need to finalize everything about two weeks before the event, so I’d appreciate your thoughts on cancellation terms in case of any changes.  

Best,  
Jessica

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your questions and I’m happy to provide more information. For groups over 150, I can offer a rate of £40 per person, with VAT included in that price. As for the menu, we typically feature dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, a selection of seasonal vegetables, and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Regarding cancellation, we generally require a notice of at least ten days prior to the event to avoid any cancellation fees. I hope this helps, and I’m looking forward to finalizing the details with you.  

Best regards,

Thank you for the updated pricing and menu details. The offer of £40 per person sounds great, and I appreciate that it includes VAT. I would like to proceed with the catering for 180 guests, with the menu options you provided. Please confirm that everything will be kosher under the London Beth Din supervision, and I would like to also include the bar package for the evening.  

Can you send over a formal agreement outlining the details, including the cancellation terms? I will aim to finalize everything within the next week.
