Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you're organizing a wedding reception on December 10th, and I would love to provide you with a catering proposal.  

We specialize in mixed menus, including options for both meat and dairy, and our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $75 per person, with a minimum guest count of 100 and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT, and we can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

In addition to food, we can also manage beverage service, but please let me know if you are interested in a full bar or just wine and beer selections. Please feel free to reach out if you have any specific menu ideas or questions.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing you provided is within our budget, but I wanted to clarify a few points. We are expecting around 150 guests, and I appreciate the flexibility with dietary options.  

Could you provide a sample menu, including some highlights? Also, are there any additional fees for staffing or equipment rental that we should be aware of? Lastly, I would like to confirm if you can accommodate kosher restrictions for all the dishes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I'm glad to hear that the pricing aligns with your budget. For your event, I can propose a sample menu featuring items such as grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, a selection of seasonal vegetables, and a delightful vegetarian pasta option. We will ensure all dishes meet kosher requirements.  

Regarding staffing, we typically charge an additional fee of $500 for setup and service. This covers our team for the event duration, and we will also provide all necessary equipment, including serving utensils and tableware.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the arrangement or if you have any further questions.
