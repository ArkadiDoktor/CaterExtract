Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special event. Our team specializes in a mixed menu, offering both meat and vegetarian options to accommodate diverse tastes.  

For pricing, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes all food preparations and service staff. This price does not include beverages, but we can arrange a separate bar service if needed. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests. Our offerings are kosher, supervised under the Star-K certification.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to discuss menu options in detail. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the details regarding your pricing and kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to see if there is any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we can confirm a larger guest count. We expect to have around 150 guests, but I want to ensure we stay within budget.  

Additionally, could you confirm if VAT is included in the price you provided? I’d also like to know more about the menu highlights you offer, particularly any signature dishes you recommend.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. I understand the need for flexibility. If you can confirm 150 guests, I can offer a revised rate of $70 per person, which includes VAT. For menu highlights, we have popular options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a delectable chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and I can send a formal proposal outlining everything.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the updated pricing and the menu highlights. The revised rate of $70 per person is acceptable, and I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our budget. Please go ahead and send a formal proposal so we can finalize the details. Additionally, I would like to confirm that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we cancel at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Looking forward to your proposal.
