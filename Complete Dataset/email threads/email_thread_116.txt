Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding celebration on June 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special occasion for you. Our catering service specializes in providing a diverse menu suitable for such events, with options that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For your wedding, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring there is something delicious for everyone. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, and this includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We typically serve a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150.  

Please note that our prices include VAT, and we ensure all our dishes meet kosher standards under strict supervision from the Orthodox Union. If you would like a bar service, we can arrange that as well for an additional fee.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I am particularly interested in the mixed menu, but I was wondering if you could offer any adjustments for a vegetarian option, as some of our guests do not eat meat.  

Also, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the $75 per person price? We might consider it depending on the overall cost. If we decide to go with your services, we expect around 80 guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I am happy to confirm that we can certainly provide vegetarian options within the mixed menu to ensure everyone is catered for. Regarding the bar service, it is not included in the $75 per person rate; however, we can offer a package for $20 per person if you decide to include it.  

For 80 guests, the total for the catering would be $6,000, which includes VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event date.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any other questions.  

Warm regards,
