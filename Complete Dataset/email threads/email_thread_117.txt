Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming conference on April 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. We specialize in a mixed menu, which includes both meat and dairy options.  

For your event, we recommend a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, focusing on seasonal ingredients. Our pricing is structured at £30 per person, and this includes VAT. We can comfortably accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and can provide a kosher menu under the supervision of the London Beth Din if needed.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements, and I can send you a sample menu based on your preferences.  

Looking forward to your response!

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details provided. I would like to confirm that we will need a kosher menu, and I am interested in seeing the sample menu you mentioned.  

However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit, as our budget is somewhat limited. Can you do £25 per person? Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in that price?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I understand the need to stick to a budget, and I'm happy to discuss this further. While £25 per person is a bit lower than we usually accommodate, I can offer it for a minimum of 100 guests. As for beverages, they are not included in the initial price but can be added for an additional £10 per person.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement, and I can send over the sample menu for your review.  

Best regards,
