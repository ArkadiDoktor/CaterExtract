Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed information about your services. Since we expect around 120 guests, I’m particularly interested in your pricing options. Could you provide a more specific quote based on that number? Additionally, could you confirm if the $45 to $65 range includes VAT?  

Lastly, are beverages included in your proposal, or would they be an additional cost? Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For 120 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $60 per person, which includes VAT. This price covers a mixed menu with items like roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and assorted salads, along with dessert. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in this price, but we can certainly arrange a bar service if needed for an additional fee.  

We can also provide setup and staffing for the event to ensure everything runs smoothly. Please let me know if this works for you, and if you would like to proceed, I can send over a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,
