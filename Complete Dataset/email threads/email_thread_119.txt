Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We specialize in creating memorable culinary experiences and would love to assist in making your event special.  

Our catering services can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, with a menu that can be customized to suit your preferences. We offer a variety of options, including meat, dairy, and mixed dishes, and we can certainly provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Kashrut Authority.  

The pricing structure is set at a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes VAT. We also provide service staff to handle setup and serving during the event. Additionally, while our catering does not include a bar, we can recommend a reliable vendor for beverages should you need one.  

Please let me know if you have specific dietary needs or preferences, and I would be happy to include accommodations in our menu proposal.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the options available. I appreciate the flexibility in your menu. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price, as our budget is a bit tighter than anticipated. Would you be able to reduce the per-person cost to $65? This would help us stay within our budget for 150 guests.  

Also, could you confirm if the meals will be prepared in a way that accommodates vegan guests? Lastly, please clarify your cancellation policy, as we would like to ensure that we are covered in case of any unforeseen changes.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your email. I understand the importance of sticking to a budget, and I'm happy to offer a revised price of $70 per person for 150 guests, which still includes VAT. Regarding dietary accommodations, we can provide vegan options alongside our standard menu, ensuring all guests are catered for.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require at least two weeks' notice for any cancellations to issue a full refund. I hope this works for you. Please let me know your thoughts on this revised proposal.  

Best,
