Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food for events of all sizes and would be delighted to assist you.  

For this event, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing structure is based on a per person rate, which is set at $65, including VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, ensuring a delightful experience for everyone.  

In addition to the food, we can provide a selection of non-alcoholic beverages as part of the package. However, if you would like alcoholic drinks, we can discuss a bar service at an additional cost. We also offer dietary accommodations, so please let us know if any guests have specific needs.  

Once you confirm the number of guests and any specific menu preferences, I can provide a more detailed proposal. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to set up a time to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The corporate gala is a significant event for us, and we want to ensure everything is perfect. I appreciate the details you've provided.  

I wanted to confirm that the $65 per person rate includes VAT as you mentioned. However, we are expecting around 120 guests, so could you confirm if there’s any flexibility with the pricing if we increase the guest count? Additionally, could you provide some examples of the menu items you usually serve? We are looking for something that is both appealing and appropriate for our audience.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I’m glad to hear back from you. Yes, the $65 per person indeed includes VAT. If you plan to increase your guest count to 150, I can offer a reduced rate of $60 per person, given the larger volume.  

As for the menu, some of our popular items include herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. We can also include a dessert platter featuring assorted pastries. Please let me know if you have preferences for specific dishes or dietary accommodations.  

If you could provide a final guest count by the end of next week, that would be helpful for our planning. I also want to remind you that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event date.  

Looking forward to your decision.  

Best,
