Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your catering needs for the upcoming wedding on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you.  

We specialize in providing a diverse menu tailored to our clients’ preferences. Our offerings include a variety of meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union. For your event, we can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT, and we would be happy to provide a complete meal that features highlights such as braised brisket, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

We also offer beverage packages, which can be customized to suit your needs, though they are not included in the base price. Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific drink options.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
Michael Rosenberg

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds delightful, especially the braised brisket. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, could you provide a lower price per person? We are also considering whether we might be able to adjust the guest count to around 120.  

Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy? It’s important for us to know just in case our plans change.  

Thank you for your help.  

Best,  
Jessica

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. I can offer a revised rate of $70 per person for the 120 guests, which still includes VAT. As for the cancellation policy, we typically require a notice of two weeks prior to the event for any cancellations.  

I hope this adjustment helps, and I can assure you that our team will ensure everything runs smoothly on the day of the wedding. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,
