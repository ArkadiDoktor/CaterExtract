Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Michael from Gourmet Gatherings, and I am reaching out to discuss your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in catering for events of all sizes, and I believe we can provide an excellent menu that will impress your guests.  

We offer a variety of options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, with vegetarian and gluten-free accommodations available upon request. Our pricing typically ranges from $45 to $75 per person depending on the menu selections you choose. All prices include VAT.  

Please let me know the estimated number of guests, as we can cater for a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 150 attendees. I look forward to hearing from you soon to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and detailed information. I appreciate the range you provided, but I'm hoping to keep the cost closer to $50 per person. We expect around 70 guests and would like to know if you can accommodate that budget. Also, could you confirm if all your offerings are kosher, and under what supervision?  

Additionally, we would be interested in having a bar setup for the event. Please let me know if that is possible and if it affects the pricing.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I can certainly work with your budget of $50 per person for a mixed menu that includes kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. This will include a selection of dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and assorted desserts.  

Regarding the bar, we can provide a cash bar setup that would be an additional cost of $15 per person, which can be added to the final invoice. For 70 guests, this would bring the total to $65 per person. Please confirm if this arrangement works for you.  

Looking forward to your feedback.
