Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit on the per-person cost, considering we expect to have around 120 guests. Additionally, do you offer any beverage packages, or would that be separate? 

I appreciate your support in making this event a success and look forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Rachel,

I understand your concern regarding the pricing. I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person if you confirm the minimum of 100 guests. As for beverages, we can provide a basic bar package for an additional $20 per person, which includes wine, beer, and soft drinks. 

Let me know if this works for you. We also have options for dietary accommodations, including gluten-free and vegan choices.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Warm regards,
