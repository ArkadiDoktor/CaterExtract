Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to introduce our catering services at Gourmet Delights. We specialize in providing high-quality food for various events, including weddings, corporate gatherings, and private parties. I understand you are organizing a gala for approximately 150 guests on November 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can assist you.  

Our pricing generally starts at £35 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can provide a mixed menu that accommodates various dietary requirements, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Additionally, all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Beth Din of London.  

Should you need beverages, we can arrange a bar service at an additional cost. Please let me know if you are interested, and we can set up a time to discuss this further.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm excited about the possibility of working with Gourmet Delights for our gala. The pricing you mentioned is within our budget, but could you confirm if VAT is included in that £35 per person? Also, while I appreciate the mixed menu proposal, could you provide a few specific dishes you would recommend?  

In terms of beverages, we would prefer to include a bar service for our guests, so if you could provide a quote for that, it would be great. Additionally, what is your cancellation policy should plans change?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your questions. The £35 per person pricing does not include VAT, which would be added on top of that amount. As for the menu, I recommend starting with a selection of smoked salmon canapés, followed by a main course of herb-crusted chicken with seasonal vegetables and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert.  

For the bar service, we can offer a package for an additional £15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled within 30 days of the event. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the details. I appreciate your quick responses. I would like to proceed with the catering services as discussed. For 150 guests, the total comes to £7,500, which includes the food, VAT, and bar service. I believe this arrangement will work perfectly for our gala. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything.  

Best regards,
