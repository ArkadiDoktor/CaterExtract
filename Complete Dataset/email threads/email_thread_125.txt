Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your event on December 12th. We would be delighted to assist with the catering for your corporate gala. We specialize in providing a diverse menu, including options for various dietary needs. Our pricing is typically structured at £45 per person, which includes VAT.  

For a gathering of this nature, we recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our team can also accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free requirements. We can offer a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, such as herb-roasted chicken, vegan pasta primavera, and a chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Please let me know the expected number of guests, as we can cater for a minimum of 50 up to a maximum of 150. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the accommodation for dietary restrictions. We anticipate around 100 guests, but I would like to confirm that the price of £45 per person is fixed. Additionally, could you clarify if beverages are included in that pricing?  

We are particularly interested in kosher options, so I would also like to know your supervision details. It’s important for us to have everything in order for our guests.  

Looking forward to your clarifications.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The £45 per person is indeed a fixed price, including VAT. However, beverages would be an additional charge, which we can discuss further if you're interested in our bar services.  

Regarding kosher supervision, we are under the supervision of the Beth Din of London, ensuring that all our offerings meet the required standards. If there are specific menu items you have in mind, we can certainly tailor our offerings to suit your event.  

Let me know your thoughts, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
