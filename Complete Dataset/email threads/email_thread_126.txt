Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on May 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse range of menus tailored to each event. For a wedding of this nature, we offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Star-K organization.  

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests and can accommodate up to 200. Additionally, we provide a selection of beverages, including a full bar, at an additional cost.  

We can also cater to various dietary needs, such as gluten-free and vegetarian options. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this proposal further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the details on the kosher supervision. However, I wanted to clarify a few points. We are expecting around 150 guests, but I would like to confirm if there is flexibility in the price per person for larger groups. Additionally, I would like to know if there are any specific cancellation terms we should be aware of.  

I look forward to your response.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. For a group of 150 guests, we can reduce the price to $70 per person. As for cancellation terms, we typically require a notice of at least 30 days before the event date for a full refund. After that, we retain a 25% deposit.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,
