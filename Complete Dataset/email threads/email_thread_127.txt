Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special occasion.  

We offer a range of menu options tailored to a variety of tastes and dietary needs. Our typical pricing starts at $50 per person for a mixed menu that includes appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This price is inclusive of VAT, and we can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests.  

Additionally, all our food is kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification, and we can provide a selection of beverages if you would like. Please let me know if you have any specific requests or dietary requirements, and I would be happy to discuss them.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound great, and I appreciate the information on the kosher supervision. We're anticipating around 120 guests, and I wanted to clarify if the $50 per person includes the bar service as well.  

Also, it would be helpful to know what kind of dishes you typically offer for the main courses and if there are any options for guests with vegetarian or gluten-free diets.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $50 per person does not include the bar service, which can be added at an additional cost, depending on the selection. For the main courses, we typically offer options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a vegetarian lasagna. We can certainly provide gluten-free and vegetarian options to accommodate your guests.  

If you’re ready to move forward, we can finalize everything with a deposit, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled within 14 days before the event.  

Let me know your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Thank you for the details regarding the menu and cancellation policy. I’d like to proceed with the catering at $50 per person for 120 guests, which brings the total to $6,000. We’ll handle the bar separately. Please confirm that VAT is included in the final price.  

Looking forward to your reply so we can finalize the arrangements.
