Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your catering needs for the charity gala you are organizing on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making this event a memorable one.  

We specialize in providing a mixed menu that is both delicious and accommodating to various dietary preferences. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, and this includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150.  

Our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary laws are respected. We can also offer options for gluten-free and vegetarian guests. Please note that our catering does not include a bar service, but we can assist in arranging beverages separately if needed.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss the menu options or if you have any specific requests.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing looks reasonable, but I was hoping to explore some adjustments. Given that we anticipate around 120 guests, would it be possible to lower the per-person rate slightly? Additionally, can you confirm if the $45 includes VAT, or will that be added on top?  

I appreciate the kosher certification as well as the dietary accommodations. Could you provide a few examples of the dishes you usually serve? Lastly, can you clarify your cancellation policy in case our plans change?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the pricing. For an event of 120 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $42 per person, and this includes VAT. As for the menu, we typically serve items like grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, a hearty vegetable lasagna, and a selection of gourmet desserts.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we require notice at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made. After that, we will retain a 50% cancellation fee.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have further questions.  

Best wishes,
