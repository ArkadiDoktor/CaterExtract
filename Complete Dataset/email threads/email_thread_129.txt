Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Corporate Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding your inquiry about catering services for the upcoming corporate event scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services.  

We specialize in a variety of menu options, including mixed cuisine that can accommodate both meat and dairy preferences. Our pricing is generally structured at thirty-five dollars per person, and we can serve a minimum of fifty guests up to a maximum of two hundred. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can offer kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. Our menu can include options such as grilled chicken, beef brisket, assorted salads, and seasonal vegetables. If you'd like, we can also provide beverage packages, though they are typically quoted separately.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific dietary needs to consider.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. I appreciate the clarity regarding the pricing and the kosher supervision. However, we are anticipating around 150 guests, and I’d like to know if you could offer a slightly lower rate, perhaps around thirty dollars per person, given that we will be catering for a larger group.  

Additionally, can you confirm if the beverage options are included in the thirty-five-dollar price, or will that be an additional charge? I want to ensure we have everything covered for our guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and your interest in our services. I understand your request for a reduced rate. I would be able to accommodate the thirty dollars per person for 150 guests, which would bring the total to four thousand five hundred dollars. This price does not include the bar service, which we can add at an additional cost of ten dollars per person if you choose.  

Please rest assured that all our meals will be kosher, and we can provide alternatives for dietary restrictions upon request. I just want to confirm that for this pricing, a deposit is required, and our cancellation policy stipulates that any cancellations made within two weeks of the event will incur a fee.  

Let me know if you would like to finalize this arrangement or if there are any other questions I can address.  

Best wishes,
