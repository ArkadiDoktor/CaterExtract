Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We would be thrilled to provide catering services for this special occasion.  

We offer a range of menu options, including a mixed menu that features both meat and dairy dishes, ensuring a delightful experience for all guests. Our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This price does not include beverages, but we can offer beverage packages separately if you are interested.  

Additionally, we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary laws are observed.  

I look forward to discussing this further and tailoring our offerings to suit your needs. Please let me know if you have any specific requests or guest numbers in mind.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the quick response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate that the meals are kosher certified and that you can accommodate dietary needs. However, we are expecting between 100 to 120 guests, and I wanted to confirm if the $75 per person rate includes VAT or if that is additional.  

Also, could you provide more details on what the beverage package entails? We are considering whether we need a bar during the reception.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person rate does not include VAT, which is charged at 20% on top of the final amount. Regarding the beverage package, we offer several options, including soft drinks, wine, and a full bar service, which can be tailored to your preferences.  

Given the number of guests, I can offer a fixed price of $70 per person if you confirm by next week. This price will include VAT and covers the setup and staffing for the event. Please let me know if that works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,  
Michael
