Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting around 80 guests for this event. I appreciate the pricing details, but I would like to clarify whether the quoted price includes VAT or if that is added on top. Additionally, could you let me know if you can provide kosher options, and if so, what supervision you have in place?  

I am also interested in knowing if beverages are included in your proposal.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $45 per person does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. We can certainly provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. In terms of beverages, we can include a selection of soft drinks, but alcoholic beverages would be an additional cost.  

For your event, I can offer a variety of dishes, including grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a hearty salad. If you anticipate more than 100 guests, we can adjust the price to $40 per person.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to confirm the catering for 80 guests at the price of $45 per person, which brings the total to $3,600. This includes the setup and staffing, as well as the kosher meals under the Orthodox Union supervision. Please note that we will require a final count at least one week before the event, and I understand your cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled two weeks in advance.  

Let's finalize the details and move forward. I appreciate your assistance!  

Best regards,
