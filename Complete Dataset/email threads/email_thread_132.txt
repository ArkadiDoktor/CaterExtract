Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I would like to clarify if the quoted price includes VAT, as well as whether beverages such as wine and soft drinks are part of the package.  

Additionally, while I am considering the mixed menu, I would like to explore some vegetarian options for guests with dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total. We typically do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can certainly provide a beverage service at an additional cost if desired.  

Regarding vegetarian options, we can easily accommodate those needs and can include dishes such as stuffed peppers and a seasonal vegetable platter. I hope this addresses your inquiries, and I'm happy to discuss any other preferences you might have.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I am happy to proceed with the catering services for 125 guests at a total price of $9,375, including the added VAT. Please ensure that the vegetarian options are included in the final menu, and I would like to discuss a beverage package as well.  

I understand the cancellation policy is flexible within two weeks before the event, which works for us. Let's finalize the details soon.  

Best regards,
