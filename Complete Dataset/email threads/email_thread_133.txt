Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you.

We can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free requests.  

For your event, our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes all setup and staffing for up to 200 guests. This price also includes VAT. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests to ensure a vibrant atmosphere. Beverages can be arranged separately if required.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. Before we proceed, I would like to clarify a couple of things. The price of $75 per person is slightly above our budget, and I was hoping to keep it around $65 without compromising the quality. Additionally, could you confirm if the bar service is included in that price, or would it be an extra charge?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I understand your budget constraints and am willing to adjust the pricing to $70 per person if we can finalize the guest count at a minimum of 120. Unfortunately, the bar service would be an additional fee, as we offer a selection of packages based on your preferences. We can provide both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a detailed menu for your consideration.  

Best,
