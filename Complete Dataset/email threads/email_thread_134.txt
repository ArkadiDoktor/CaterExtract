Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, especially the roasted chicken. However, I wanted to clarify a few details. We are expecting around 80 guests, but we may have some flexibility with that number. Could you confirm if the $50 per person price remains the same for this range?  

Additionally, I would like to know if you offer kosher options, as some of our attendees will require it. If so, what supervision do you have in place? Lastly, are beverages included in the quoted price?  

Thanks for your help!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The $50 per person rate is indeed valid for 50 to 150 guests, so that works for your expected number. We do offer kosher catering under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary needs are met.  

As for beverages, we can provide a bar package for an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. If you prefer a dry event, we can certainly adjust the menu accordingly.  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I can prepare a formal proposal with these details.  

Best regards,

Thank you for the clarifications. I would like to move forward with the catering for 80 guests at the agreed price of $50 per person, making the total $4,000, including VAT. Please include the kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and I will opt for the bar package as well.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, could you confirm the terms before we finalize this? I look forward to receiving the formal proposal soon.
