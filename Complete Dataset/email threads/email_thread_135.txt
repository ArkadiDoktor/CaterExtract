Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and we recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. This price includes VAT, and we can also provide a selection of beverages for an additional cost. We can offer dietary accommodations for gluten-free and vegetarian guests as well.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the inclusion of dietary options. We are currently expecting around 80 guests, and I wanted to clarify if the $45 per person covers everything or if additional fees would apply for the beverages as you mentioned.  

Could you also provide some examples of the menu items you typically offer? We want to ensure that all our guests are satisfied with the meal choices.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear back from you. The $45 per person does cover the meal but does not include beverages, which we can provide at an additional charge depending on your selection, typically ranging from $10 to $15 per person.  

As for the menu, we have popular items like herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads. We can also customize the menu based on your preferences. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed, and I can send over a formal quote.  

Best wishes,

Please also send over the cancellation policy and any additional notes regarding setup and staffing. I look forward to finalizing our agreement.
