Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The price range you mentioned works for us, but I would like to narrow down the options to a fixed price per person. Could you provide a more defined menu that falls within the $60 per person range? Additionally, could you confirm if beverages, including a bar, are included in that price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear back from you. For a fixed price of $60 per person, we can offer a delightful menu that includes roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, seasonal vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet salads. Beverages, including soft drinks and coffee, are included, but the bar service would be an additional cost.  

We aim to ensure that the setup is seamless, with our staff available for the duration of the event. As for the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for any full refunds.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
