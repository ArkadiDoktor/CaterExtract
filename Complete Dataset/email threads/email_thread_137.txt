Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on March 15th and are looking for catering options. We would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

Our services include a variety of menu options, including a mixed cuisine selection that features grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of desserts. We can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical council, if that is a requirement for your guests.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per person rate, typically ranging from $50 to $75, depending on the menu selections you choose. This price includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Additionally, we can provide a beverage bar at an extra cost.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or specific dietary accommodations.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options you outlined sound appealing. However, I would like to confirm if the per person pricing includes the beverage bar as well, or if that is separate. Also, could you clarify the types of dietary options you can offer?  

We are estimating around 70 guests at this point, but I want to ensure we have the best options available. Please let me know the final price if we were to proceed with the fixed menu you mentioned.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your response. The beverage bar is indeed an additional cost; it typically adds around $15 per guest. For dietary options, we can accommodate vegetarian, gluten-free, and nut-free requests without any issues.  

If you were to select the fixed menu I proposed, the price would be $65 per person, which totals $4,550 for 70 guests, excluding the bar. If you decide to include the bar, it would bring the total to $5,200.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, as I can hold the date for you until the end of the week.  

Best regards,
