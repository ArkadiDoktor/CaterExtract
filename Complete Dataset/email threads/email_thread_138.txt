Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our standard pricing is set at $50 per person, which includes a variety of dishes tailored to suit your guests' preferences. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests for this event.  

All of our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets high standards. Our menu features a mixed selection, with options like herb-roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and seasonal salads. We can also provide vegan and gluten-free options upon request.  

Please note that the price mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. We also offer a full bar service, but it is priced separately.  

If you have any specific requests or dietary needs, please let us know. We look forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I am particularly interested in the mixed menu and the kosher supervision. However, the price is a bit higher than we planned. Would you be open to negotiating the price if we confirm a minimum of 75 guests?  

Also, could you clarify if the $50 per person includes any beverages, or will those be an additional cost? I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. If you confirm 75 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person. This price still excludes VAT and does not include beverages, which would be billed separately.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a detailed menu for your review. We can also discuss the cancellation terms, which typically allow for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Please include the full bar service in the final proposal, as we want to ensure our guests have an enjoyable experience.  

Could you also send over the detailed menu and confirm the setup and staffing arrangements for the event? I look forward to finalizing everything with you.
