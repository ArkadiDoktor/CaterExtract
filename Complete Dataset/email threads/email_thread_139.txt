Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision as well. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would it be possible to adjust the price to $65 per person?  

Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 price includes all setup and staffing costs? I want to ensure everything is covered for the event.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the budget considerations. While I can’t go down to $65 per person, I can offer you a revised price of $70 per person if we streamline the menu options slightly. This price will still include all setup and staffing costs.  

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your flexibility. The revised price of $70 per person works for us, and I appreciate you confirming that setup and staffing are included. Let’s move forward with this arrangement for 100 guests, bringing the total to $7,000.  

Please send over the contract when you have a moment, and let me know the cancellation policy. I’m looking forward to working together to make this event a success!  

Best wishes,
