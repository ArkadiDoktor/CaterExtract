Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there's any flexibility in the cost per person. Given our budget constraints, a range of $60 to $70 would be more appropriate. Additionally, we would like to confirm if the bar, including soft drinks and wine, is part of the package or if that would be an additional cost.  

I appreciate your attention to dietary accommodations as well. We expect a few guests with gluten sensitivities, so it would be helpful to know which dishes could be made gluten-free.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing. We can adjust the cost to $70 per person, which will still allow us to provide a high-quality experience for your attendees. Regarding the bar, we can include a basic selection of beverages at that price. However, for premium options, we might need to discuss a supplemental charge.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly create gluten-free alternatives for the main courses and desserts. I hope this meets your expectations.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with these adjustments.  

Best,

I would like to confirm the catering for 150 guests at $70 per person, totaling $10,500, including VAT. Please ensure everything is kosher under the Rabbi's Council supervision.  

I would also like to have a selection of soft drinks and wine included in the bar. If we need to make any last-minute changes, could you clarify the cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your confirmation.
