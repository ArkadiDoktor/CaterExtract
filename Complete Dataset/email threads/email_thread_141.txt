Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our catering typically includes a range of delicious dishes, and we can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For your event, we recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy. We pride ourselves on using high-quality ingredients, and all our meat is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

In terms of pricing, we usually charge $75 per person, which includes setup, service staff, and all necessary equipment. This rate includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Additionally, we can arrange for drinks, although they are not included in the base price.  

Please let me know if you're interested, and I can send over a sample menu and further details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $75 per person rate sounds reasonable, but we are hoping to stick to a budget of $65 per person if possible. Is there any flexibility with your pricing?  

Also, could you clarify the cancellation policy? It's important for us to know in case of unforeseen circumstances. We are expecting around 100 guests, but we want to keep the option open to adjust if needed.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your consideration. While our standard rate is $75 per person, I can offer a reduced price of $70 per person if you confirm by the end of the week. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if you cancel at least two weeks prior to the event.  

As for the guest count, we can certainly accommodate your range, and I will ensure that we have the necessary provisions for any dietary restrictions you may have.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a tentative agreement.  

Best,
