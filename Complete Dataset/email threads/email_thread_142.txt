Dear Emily,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be thrilled to provide catering services for this special event.  

Our menu offers a delightful mix of meat and dairy options, suitable for various tastes. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, with pricing set at $45 per person. This includes VAT. Additionally, our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all dietary requirements.  

We can also provide a selection of beverages, but please note that a full bar service would be an additional cost. If you have any specific dietary needs or preferences, please let me know, and I will ensure we can accommodate them.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a couple of things. We are expecting around 150 guests, and while the $45 per person fits within our budget, could you provide a fixed price for the total? Also, could you confirm if the beverages include soft drinks or if they are separate?  

Lastly, we might need to accommodate a few vegan guests. Would you be able to include some vegan options in the menu?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. For 150 guests, the total would come to $6,750, which includes everything we discussed. Regarding beverages, we can provide a selection of soft drinks as part of the package, but any alcoholic beverages would need to be added separately.  

I can certainly include vegan options in the menu. Perhaps we can offer a delicious quinoa salad and a roasted vegetable platter to ensure all guests are catered for.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
