Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate seminar on March 15th. We would be thrilled to provide catering services for this event. We specialize in offering a diverse menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, as well as pareve dishes to accommodate different dietary needs.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $45, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that our prices include VAT.  

We understand the importance of dietary restrictions, and we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. If you would like to include beverages or a bar service, please let us know, as this would be an additional cost.  

Once you confirm the number of guests and any specific menu preferences, I can provide a more detailed proposal. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The per-person rate of $45 works for us, but we would like to discuss the inclusion of beverages. Could you clarify what beverage options could be added, and how much they would increase the total cost?  

Additionally, we are expecting around 100 guests, and if possible, I would love to see some sample menu options, particularly for the meat dishes, as that would be our primary focus.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. For beverages, we can offer a selection that includes soft drinks, juices, and coffee for an additional $10 per person, bringing the total to $55. If you’re interested in a full bar service, that would be a bit higher, starting at $20 per person.  

Regarding the menu, I can suggest items such as grilled chicken with lemon herb sauce, beef brisket, and a vegetarian stuffed pepper, which have all been popular at previous events. Please let me know if these options align with your needs or if you have specific dishes in mind.  

Once we finalize the menu and guest count, I will send over the formal proposal.  

Best,

Dear David,  

Thank you for the clarification on the beverage options. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the catering at the total cost of $55 per person, including the beverage selection. We will finalize the guest count at around 100.  

Please go ahead and send the formal proposal with the menu items we discussed. I also want to confirm that the cancellation policy allows a full refund if we cancel at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Looking forward to your proposal.  

Best regards,
