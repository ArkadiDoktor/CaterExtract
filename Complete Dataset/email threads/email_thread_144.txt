Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality kosher catering, and I would love to help make your event a success.  

For a guest count between 100 to 150, our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of seasonal vegetarian dishes. We ensure that all food is prepared under Orthodox supervision. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

We can also discuss beverage options separately, as our standard packages do not include a bar. We can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Let me know if you’d like to go over the menu further or if you have any specific requests in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds lovely, but given our budget constraints, we are hoping to stay around $40 per person. Would you be able to adjust the menu or provide any alternatives at that price?  

Additionally, we’re expecting around 120 guests, and I’d like to clarify if the pricing you provided includes setup and staff for the evening. If we decide to move forward, what would be your cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the importance of staying within budget. We can offer a slightly modified menu that would include options like baked chicken thighs and a pasta primavera for $40 per person. This price would still include VAT, and we can provide setup and staff for the evening at no extra charge.  

As for cancellation, we typically require notice at least 14 days prior to the event date to avoid any cancellation fees. Please let me know if this works for you or if you would like to discuss other options.  

Warm regards,
