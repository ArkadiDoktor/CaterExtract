Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate your willingness to accommodate dietary needs. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price slightly. Given our budget constraints, would you be open to discussing a rate of $45 per person, while still providing the same quality of food and service?  

Additionally, could you confirm whether you provide setup and staffing for the event? I want to ensure everything runs smoothly on the day.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget considerations. I can agree to the price of $45 per person, provided we keep the minimum guest count at 50. Our team will also handle the setup and staffing, ensuring everything is in place before the event starts.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I'll prepare a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,
