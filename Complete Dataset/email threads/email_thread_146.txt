Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety in your menu. However, I was hoping to get a clearer idea about the minimum number of guests you can accommodate at the £45 per person rate. Additionally, can you confirm if the food is kosher and under which supervision?  

I’m also interested in knowing if the price includes any bar service or if that would be additional.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The minimum number of guests we can cater for at the £45 per person rate is 100, which aligns with your expected attendance. Our food is indeed kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din.  

The pricing does not include bar service; we can provide a range of beverages at an additional cost, depending on your choices. If you decide to go with us, we'll also handle setup and staffing for the event.  

Please let me know if you’d like to proceed or if you have any further queries.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I believe we can move forward with your proposal. I accept the terms for 120 guests at £45 per person, which totals £5,400 and includes VAT. Please prepare a contract that outlines the details, including the kosher supervision and the cancellation policy, which I hope is reasonable.  

I look forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Best,
