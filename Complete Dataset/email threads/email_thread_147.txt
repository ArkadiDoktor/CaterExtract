Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We specialize in providing exceptional culinary experiences and would love to assist you with this event.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, our pricing structure is $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We offer a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can arrange for beverages as well at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu preferences in mind.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing looks reasonable, but I was hoping to keep it closer to $60 per person. Additionally, could you confirm if the $75 includes VAT or if it will be added on top? We are considering around 120 guests and would also like to know about your cancellation terms.  

I appreciate your help and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand your budget considerations. While $60 per person is challenging for our standard offerings, I can propose a slightly simplified menu that would bring the cost down to $68 per person, including VAT. This would allow us to maintain quality while meeting your budget.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least seven days prior to the event for a full refund. If you have any specific dishes in mind that might help us fine-tune the menu, I would be more than happy to accommodate.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Warm regards,

We're excited about the menu options you can provide, and I trust your team will take care of all setup and staffing needs.  

Please confirm the final details, and I will send over the contract for us to finalize everything. Thank you for your assistance.
