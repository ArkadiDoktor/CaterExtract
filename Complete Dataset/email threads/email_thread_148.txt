Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out from Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate event scheduled for June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to various occasions.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, accommodating a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, should that be a requirement for your guests.  

In addition, we can arrange for a bar service with a selection of wines and beers, or we can focus solely on the food if you prefer. Our menu can include highlights such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a variety of salads.  

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss this further or if you have any specific dietary requirements.  

Best regards,  
Martin Thompson

Hi Martin,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. The event is shaping up nicely, and I appreciate the flexibility in your menu options. However, I would like to clarify a couple of points.  

We are expecting around 120 guests, and while the $45 per person is reasonable, would you be open to adjusting the price slightly if we confirm a larger number of guests? Additionally, can you confirm whether the bar service is included in that price or if it will be an extra cost?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,  
Sarah Mitchell

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your response and understand the need for flexibility with the pricing. If you can confirm 120 guests, I can offer a revised price of $42 per person. This will include the bar service with a selection of wines and beers.  

Please note that our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to one week prior to the event, so I hope that gives you some peace of mind. I am happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions your guests may have as well.  

Let me know if this works for you!  

Best,
