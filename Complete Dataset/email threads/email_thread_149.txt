Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided. Since our gala will have approximately 150 guests, I wanted to clarify whether the meal you mentioned is kosher. We're also considering including a bar service for the evening.

Could you provide more details about the menu options and any typical highlights? Additionally, what are your cancellation terms?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your inquiry. I can confirm that our meals can be kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. The menu options include dishes like herb-crusted chicken, seared salmon, and a variety of vegetarian appetizers. 

Regarding the bar, we offer a package that includes a selection of wines and beers, but it is an additional $20 per person. Our cancellation policy states that cancellations made more than two weeks in advance will incur a 25% fee, while cancellations within two weeks are non-refundable.

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.

Best,
