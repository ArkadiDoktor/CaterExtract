Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this occasion. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that accommodates various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For this event, we typically offer a range of meal types, and I can suggest a mixed menu featuring items such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can also provide kosher options, supervised by the Orthodox Union, should you require.  

Our pricing structure is generally set at £30 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and this pricing includes VAT. A bar service can be added for an additional fee if needed.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there are specific requirements you have in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher option. However, we are considering a maximum of 120 guests, and I would like to confirm if the price remains the same if we decide to go with 100 guests instead. Also, could you clarify if the bar service would include a range of alcoholic beverages?  

I am also curious about your cancellation policy, as we are still in the planning stages.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The price of £30 per person will remain the same for up to 120 guests, so you would be looking at a total of £3,000 if you decide on that number. Regarding the bar service, we offer a selection that includes wines, beers, and soft drinks, and we can customize it based on your preferences.  

As for our cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund. After that, a cancellation fee of 50% of the total cost would apply.  

Let me know if you would like to move forward, and I can prepare a formal agreement for you.
