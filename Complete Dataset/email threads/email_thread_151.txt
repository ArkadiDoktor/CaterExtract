Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Corporate Event

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. We specialize in providing exquisite catering services for corporate events, and I understand that you are planning a conference on November 15th for approximately 100 guests.

We offer a range of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed selections, with the ability to accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian. For your event, our pricing is set at £35 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din, if that is a requirement.

Please let me know if you're interested, and I can provide you with a sample menu and more details regarding setup and staffing.

Best regards,

David Rosen

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound appealing, and I appreciate the kosher option. However, we are also considering budget constraints and would like to know if there's any flexibility on the price per person. Additionally, could you clarify whether the £35 includes VAT? 

Lastly, we may have between 80 to 120 guests, depending on final confirmations. Could you provide a breakdown of what would be included in that price, especially regarding beverages and any setup requirements?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your questions. I can accommodate a reduced price of £30 per person for your event, which includes VAT. This price covers a full buffet service, including a variety of dishes such as roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and seasonal salads, along with dessert options.

However, please note that the bar service is not included in this price, and we typically recommend a separate beverage package based on your preferences. Should the guest count fluctuate, we are happy to work with a minimum of 80 and a maximum of 120 attendees. 

As for cancellation, we require a notice of at least one week prior to the event to avoid any cancellation fees. 

Let me know if this works for you, and I can finalize the details.

Best,  
David Rosen
