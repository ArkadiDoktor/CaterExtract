Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the catering services for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for December 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to provide our services for your event.  

Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a variety of dishes to suit different palates. We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests and offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. All our meals are prepared under strict rabbinical supervision, ensuring they meet kosher standards.  

Additionally, we can provide beverage service, but it is not included in the base price. If you need any specific dietary accommodations, please let us know, and we will do our best to cater to those requests.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I have a few questions before we proceed. Since we are expecting around 150 guests, would you be able to adjust the price per person if we reach a higher number of attendees? Additionally, could you clarify the VAT situation—will it be included in the price you quoted?  

Also, we are interested in including a bar service. What would that add to the overall cost? Lastly, since our guests have various dietary needs, could you give me examples of accommodations you can provide?  

Thanks for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person if you confirm the catering for 200 guests. The price I provided does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total.  

For the bar service, we typically charge an additional $15 per person for a standard package, which includes beer, wine, and soft drinks. Regarding dietary accommodations, we can provide gluten-free and vegan options, as well as vegetarian dishes. For example, our quinoa salad and roasted vegetable platter are popular choices.  

Let me know if this works for you or if you need any further adjustments.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the updated information. I appreciate your flexibility on pricing and the details regarding dietary accommodations. I would like to confirm the catering for 150 guests at the adjusted rate of $40 per person, making the total $6,000 plus VAT. Please also include the bar service in the final arrangement.  

I understand that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event, which works for us. I look forward to receiving the contract and any next steps.
