Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Bites, as I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on December 15th. We specialize in catering for events like yours and would love to provide a proposal for your menu needs.  

We can offer a range of options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing typically runs at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Manchester Beth Din.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, but please note that a full bar service is available at an extra charge. We are also happy to accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your vision, and we can discuss it further.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit on the per person cost, considering we might have a larger group. Also, could you clarify if the £45 includes the beverages you mentioned, or is that separate?  

While I appreciate the kosher options, I need to ensure that all dishes meet our requirements for dietary restrictions. We expect around 120 guests, but I will confirm the final count closer to the date.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can adjust the pricing to £40 per person if you confirm the minimum of 100 guests. The beverages are not included in that price, so we can discuss a package that works for your event.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly work with you to ensure all guests are catered for, including options for those with specific restrictions. Please let me know if you would like to discuss the beverage options as well.  

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to finalizing the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility with the pricing and your willingness to accommodate dietary needs. I would like to proceed with the £40 per person for a mixed menu, confirming 120 guests. I will also need to discuss the beverage options separately, as I want to ensure we have a good selection.  

Please provide me with the final agreement and cancellation terms when you can. I look forward to working with you to make this event a success.  

Best regards,
