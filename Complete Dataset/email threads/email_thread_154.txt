Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the catering services for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a delightful menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at £45 per person, which includes a range of menu items, such as roasted chicken, vegetable lasagna, and seasonal salads. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests comfortably. Additionally, all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din, ensuring it meets all dietary requirements.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific preferences for the menu. We can also arrange for a bar service at an additional cost if required.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the information provided. The menu sounds great, particularly the roasted chicken. However, I was hoping to keep the budget a bit lower if possible. Would you consider offering a fixed price of £40 per person instead?  

Also, can you confirm if VAT is included in your pricing? We are expecting around 120 guests, so if we can settle on the price, we can finalize the details soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concerns regarding the budget. We can agree to the £40 per person rate if the minimum guest count is met at 120. This price does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

In terms of menu options, we can look at including some pareve dishes to accommodate various dietary restrictions. Our team can ensure that all dietary needs are met, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the arrangements.  

Best,

Thank you for adjusting the pricing and for clarifying the VAT. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to confirm the £40 per person rate for 120 guests, bringing the total to £4,800 plus VAT. We will require a full setup with staff for the event, and please include a selection of beverages in the package.  

The cancellation policy you mentioned is agreeable to us, and I look forward to working with you on the menu details. Please send over the contract so we can finalize everything.
