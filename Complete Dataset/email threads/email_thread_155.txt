Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this special occasion. Our menu features a delightful selection of dishes, including beef brisket, herb-roasted chicken, and a variety of vegetarian options. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegan upon request.  

We typically work with a price structure of $75 per person, which includes a full dinner service along with all necessary equipment and staffing. This price is subject to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please note that this pricing includes VAT. We can discuss beverage options further if you are interested in a bar service.  

Looking forward to your feedback.

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the details provided. I wanted to clarify whether the meals are kosher and the nature of the supervision. It’s important for our guests. Also, regarding the bar service, could you provide more information on what that would entail and any additional costs?  

Additionally, I would like to confirm the cancellation policy in case our plans change as we get closer to the date.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I’m glad to hear you liked the menu options. Our meals are indeed kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Regarding the bar service, we can provide a selection of wines and beers for an additional $20 per person. 

As for the cancellation policy, you may cancel up to two weeks before the event date for a full refund, but cancellations made within that timeframe will incur a 50% charge. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like to proceed with the arrangement.  

Best,
