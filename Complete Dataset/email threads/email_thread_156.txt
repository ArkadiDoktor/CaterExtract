Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I wanted to clarify if the $45 per person includes beverages or if those are separate. Additionally, we may have dietary restrictions to accommodate, such as gluten-free and vegetarian options.  

Could you please confirm these details? I am looking forward to finalizing everything soon.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up message. To clarify, the $45 per person does not include beverages, but we can provide a bar package at an additional cost if desired. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian requests within the menu.  

Regarding the cancellation terms, we typically require a notice of 14 days before the event to avoid any cancellation fees. Please let me know your thoughts, and we can proceed from there.  

Warm regards,
