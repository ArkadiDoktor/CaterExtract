Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the initial details. I appreciate that you can accommodate dietary restrictions. We expect around 120 guests and would like to confirm that the menu will indeed be kosher. Could you clarify the supervision for this?  

Also, I'd like to know if the price you quoted includes beverages or if that would be an additional cost. We are considering a bar but want to keep our budget in mind.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. The kosher menu will be under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority, ensuring all standards are met. Regarding beverages, our initial price does not include a bar service; however, we can offer a selection of non-alcoholic drinks for an additional $10 per person.  

If you’d like to include an open bar, we can provide a package starting at $25 per person, which includes a range of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a more detailed menu and options.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarification regarding the kosher supervision. I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests, including the non-alcoholic beverage package. This brings the total to $55 per person, which comes to $6,600. Please confirm that this price includes VAT and that we can finalize the menu soon.  

Additionally, could you outline the cancellation terms? Once I have that information, I will be ready to proceed with a contract.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,
