Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the dietary accommodations offered. However, our budget is a bit tighter than anticipated, and I wanted to see if there’s any flexibility in the pricing. Would you be willing to lower the price to £40 per person? Additionally, could you confirm if the food is kosher and under what supervision?  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand budget constraints, and I can offer the price of £42 per person, which still includes VAT. Regarding the kosher status, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din.  

As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can discuss options if you're interested. Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu details.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for adjusting the price and for clarifying the kosher supervision. I’m happy to proceed with the £42 per person rate. Please confirm that the final price will cover the full service, including setup and staffing for 100 guests. I would also like to finalize the menu with some of your highlighted dishes.  

Could you provide a draft contract outlining the cancellation policy? Once I have that, we can move forward.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best regards,
