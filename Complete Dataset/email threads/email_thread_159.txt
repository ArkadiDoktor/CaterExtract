Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding your upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We specialize in event catering and would be delighted to provide our services for this occasion.  

We offer a variety of menu options suitable for different dietary needs. Our typical pricing is structured at $75 per person and includes VAT. For a successful event, we recommend a minimum of 100 guests and can accommodate up to 250. Our menu can be tailored to include kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can also provide a selection of beverages, including a full bar, upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific preferences in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed a significant event for us, and I appreciate your detailed proposal. While the pricing per person seems reasonable, I was hoping to explore if there is any flexibility, particularly if we can confirm a guest count closer to 200. Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service could be included in that price, or would it be an extra charge?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Warm regards,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I completely understand your concerns regarding pricing. For a confirmed guest count of 200, I can offer you a reduced rate of $70 per person. The bar service would be an additional charge, but we could create a package deal that includes a selection of wines and soft drinks to keep it manageable.  

Please let me know if this adjustment aligns with your budget, and I would be happy to finalize the menu details and other arrangements.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility and the adjusted pricing of $70 per person for 200 guests. I would like to proceed with the arrangement, including the kosher menu under the supervision you mentioned. Please confirm that the final price of $14,000 includes VAT, and I expect to receive the cancellation policy and any contract details at your earliest convenience.  

Looking forward to working with you on this event.
