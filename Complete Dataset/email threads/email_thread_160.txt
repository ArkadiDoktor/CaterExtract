I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to our clients' needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes options such as grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a variety of sides. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and this includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests, ensuring that we have sufficient staff and resources available for your needs.  

Please note that our food is kosher and prepared under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council. We can also offer a selection of beverages, though a full bar would be an additional cost. If you have any dietary restrictions to consider, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great! However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Our budget is quite tight, and I would appreciate it if you could consider a lower rate, perhaps around $40 per person. Additionally, could you confirm whether the beverages are included in the total price?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I understand your budget constraints, and I can offer the price of $40 per person if we can secure a minimum of 75 guests. This rate will still include VAT, and I can include a selection of soft drinks within that price. However, if you would like to include alcoholic beverages, we would need to discuss that separately.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare the final agreement.  

Best wishes,
