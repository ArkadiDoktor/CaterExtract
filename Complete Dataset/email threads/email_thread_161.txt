Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes a mixed menu of delicious options tailored to your needs. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. We pride ourselves on offering dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, to ensure all attendees have suitable choices.  

I would also like to confirm that our food is kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification. Beverages and bar services can be arranged separately if desired. All prices include VAT.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to discuss a few details. We are expecting around 120 guests, so if we can settle on the final price, that would be great. Could you clarify if the $45 per person is the final amount, or are there any additional charges we should anticipate?   

Also, I would appreciate it if you could include a sample menu highlighting some of the dishes we could offer. We are particularly interested in the vegetarian options as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Rachel

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your reply and for clarifying the number of guests. The $45 per person is indeed the final price, and it includes VAT. I would be happy to send over a sample menu. For the vegetarian selections, I recommend our roasted vegetable platter and quinoa salad.  

Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than two weeks before the event. However, after that, we would retain a deposit of 25%.  

Let me know if you have any other questions or if you are ready to move forward.  

Best,  
David
