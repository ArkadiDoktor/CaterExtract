Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our menu typically features a selection of meat dishes, but we can also accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, if needed.  

For this event, we usually work with a pricing structure of $75 per person, which includes a full three-course meal and service. We can cater from a minimum of 50 guests up to a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that our prices include VAT.  

Additionally, I want to mention that our food is kosher and is supervised by the local Kashrut authority. We can also provide a bar service upon request, though this will be an additional cost. Please let me know if you’d like to see some sample menu options, and I can prepare a detailed proposal for you.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in the price if we increase our guest count to 175. Also, could you clarify what the menu options would look like? We want to ensure it aligns with our theme and dietary needs.  

I’m particularly interested in the inclusion of beverages in the package. If we decide to include a bar service, could you provide some options and pricing for that as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Regarding the bar service, we can provide a basic package starting at $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. I want to assure you that we can accommodate all dietary restrictions as needed.  

Please confirm if you would like to proceed, or if you have any other adjustments in mind.
