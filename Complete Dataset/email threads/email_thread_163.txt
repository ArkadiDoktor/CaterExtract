Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing of $75 per person is within our budget, but I was hoping to see if there is any flexibility, especially if we confirm a larger guest count. Additionally, could you clarify if the quoted price includes VAT?  

I'm also interested in the possibility of including a bar service for our guests. We anticipate around 150 attendees, and I would like to confirm the dishes you recommend for our menu.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

As for the bar service, we can provide a selection of wines and cocktails at an additional cost of $15 per person. Our recommended dishes include herb-roasted chicken, quinoa salad, and a variety of seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate any dietary needs, including gluten-free and vegan options.
