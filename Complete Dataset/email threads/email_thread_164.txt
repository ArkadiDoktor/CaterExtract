Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your event on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your gala dinner. Our menu features a delightful selection of dishes, focusing on a mixed cuisine that includes both meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes all food and setup. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT. We do not include beverage service in this package, but we can arrange a bar service for an additional fee.  

If you have specific dietary requirements, we can certainly cater to vegetarian and gluten-free options. I would be happy to discuss the details of the menu further and answer any questions you may have.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Tom,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing structure seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit since we are expecting closer to 120 guests. Would you be willing to consider a fixed price for the entire event? Also, could you clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT or if it will be added on top of that?  

Additionally, I am interested in the kinds of dishes you would typically recommend for a mixed menu. I appreciate your flexibility with dietary options, but are there any particular limitations we should be aware of?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding pricing. For a fixed price for 120 guests, we can offer a total of $8,400, which does include VAT. Should you decide to proceed, we would require a deposit to secure the date, with a cancellation policy of up to 14 days in advance for a full refund.  

Regarding the menu, we can feature options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of side dishes, ensuring a pleasing experience for both meat and dairy preferences. Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, or if you have any further adjustments in mind.
