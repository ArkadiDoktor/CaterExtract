Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, I’m hoping to stay within a budget of $40 per person. Is there any flexibility in your pricing, or could we look at alternative menu options that might bring costs down?  

Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are included in the per-person rate?  

Thank you,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback on the pricing. We can adjust the menu to include options like roasted vegetable platters and simpler salads to meet your budget of $40 per person. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in that price, but we can offer a beverage package for an additional $10 per person.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the adjusted menu at $40 per person, with the additional beverage package for $10. This brings our total to $50 per person for 100 guests, which is $5,000 in total. Please confirm that this includes VAT.  

Also, I understand that the cancellation policy is a full refund if we cancel at least two weeks prior to the event date. I will look forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
