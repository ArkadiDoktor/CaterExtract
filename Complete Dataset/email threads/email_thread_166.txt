Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Silver Plate Catering for your upcoming gala dinner on December 10th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to assist you in making your event a success.  

For a sit-down dinner, we can offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests. We also offer dietary accommodations for vegetarians and other specific needs upon request.  

Please note that our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, and we can provide details on the certification if needed. However, beverages, including a bar service, would be an additional cost. All prices include VAT.  

I would be happy to send over a sample menu and discuss any specifics or preferences you may have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate your flexibility with menu options and dietary accommodations. We are expecting around 120 guests, so the pricing aligns well with our budget.  

However, I would like to clarify the final price. Does the $75 per person cover all setup and service charges? Additionally, what are the cancellation terms should our plans change? It would also be helpful to know what specific dishes you would recommend for the menu.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. Yes, the $75 per person includes all setup and service charges, and the final price for 120 guests would be $9,000. As for cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund; otherwise, we would retain a deposit of 25%.  

For the menu, I would suggest our signature beef brisket, a selection of seasonal roasted vegetables, and a delicious dairy-free chocolate cake for dessert. If you have any specific preferences or themes, we can certainly tailor the options further.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
