Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Bites Catering. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. Our team specializes in a variety of menus, and we can offer a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken skewers, roasted vegetable platters, and a selection of desserts.  

For pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests for this event. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. Please let me know if you would like to include a beverage service, as that is typically an additional cost.  

If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, we can certainly work to accommodate those. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the pricing information and the flexibility regarding dietary options. Before we proceed, I wanted to clarify a couple of points.  

Is the $45 per person the final price, including everything? Also, we may have closer to 300 guests, so could you let me know how that would impact the pricing? We are interested in a full-service option, including beverages. Lastly, could you confirm the cancellation policy if we decide to make any changes later?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person does cover all food items and includes VAT. For 300 guests, we can maintain the same price, but I would recommend finalizing the guest count as soon as possible to ensure everything runs smoothly.  

Regarding beverages, we can offer a package that includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks for an additional $15 per person. Our cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event without penalty, but any changes after that may incur fees.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare a formal agreement.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I would like to proceed with the catering for 300 guests at the price of $45 per person, plus the beverage package at $15 per person. This brings the total to $18,000, and I appreciate that this includes VAT.  

I also confirm that we will require kosher meals under the supervision you've mentioned. Please prepare the agreement, and let’s ensure we can finalize everything by November 1st to avoid any cancellation issues.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best regards,
