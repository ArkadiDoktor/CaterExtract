Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in providing exceptional culinary experiences and would be delighted to assist you.  

For your event, we offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of options such as herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable risotto, and a selection of seasonal salads. Our pricing is structured at $60 per person, which includes a full buffet setup, staff for service, and all necessary equipment. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and can provide kosher options under the supervision of the Star-K.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to include a bar service, which can be arranged at an additional cost. We look forward to the opportunity to work with you.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, we are looking to keep the budget a bit tighter. Would you be able to offer a lower price per person if we reduce the menu options? We are also considering a guest count closer to 75.  

Additionally, I'd like to clarify whether the $60 price includes VAT or if that will be added on top. Could you also let me know if the bar service is a fixed price per guest?  

Thanks in advance for your help!  

Best,  
Jessica

Hi Jessica,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. If we simplify the menu to include two main dishes and a couple of salads, I could offer a revised price of $50 per person. This would still allow us to provide quality food and service for your 75 guests.  

To answer your question, the $50 price does not include VAT, which would be an additional 20%. The bar service can be arranged at $15 per guest for a selection of wines and beers. We are committed to making this event a success and can work together to finalize the details.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the revised proposal. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu and pricing. I would like to proceed with the $50 per person offer, and I understand that VAT will be added later. Please go ahead and prepare the arrangements for the 75 guests, including the bar service.  

If we need to make any changes, I understand the cancellation policy allows for adjustments up to a week before the event. I’m excited to work with you and look forward to receiving the contract.  

Best regards,  
Jessica
