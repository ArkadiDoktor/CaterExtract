Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests. Our menu features a delicious selection of mixed dishes, including options like herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetable lasagna, and we can also cater to special dietary requirements if needed.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining your pricing. The menu options sound delightful. However, I was hoping to explore the possibility of adjusting the price. Our budget is a bit tight, and I wonder if you could offer a rate closer to $65 per person while still providing a good selection of dishes.  

Additionally, could you confirm if the food is kosher? If so, what supervision do you have in place? We will have around 100 guests attending.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thanks for getting back to me. I understand the budget constraints, and I can offer a revised price of $70 per person for your event. The food will be kosher, supervised under the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards of quality and adherence to dietary laws.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can arrange for that separately if you're interested. We can certainly accommodate the 100 guests you mentioned, and I will ensure that we have options for various dietary needs as well.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for adjusting the pricing and confirming the kosher supervision. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the arrangement at the rate of $70 per person for 100 guests, which brings the total to $7,000. That price is acceptable to us, and we will need a variety of options, including vegetarian dishes.  

Please send over the formal agreement when you can, and let me know about the cancellation terms. I look forward to working with you to make this event a success.
