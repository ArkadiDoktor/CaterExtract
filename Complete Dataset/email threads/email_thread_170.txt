Our catering options include a variety of dishes that can accommodate different dietary needs. We offer a mixed menu that features delightful meat and vegetarian selections. Our pricing structure is flexible; we typically charge $55 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests comfortably.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound great, and I appreciate the flexibility in pricing. Could you clarify if the $55 per person includes both the bar service and setup fees? We are expecting around 120 guests and would love to know if there’s any room for negotiation on the price, especially if we decide to limit the bar options.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Rebecca,

I appreciate your questions. The $55 per person covers the meal and setup but does not include the bar service, which can be added for an additional fee. Given your expected guest count of 120, I can offer a reduced price of $50 per person if you choose a limited bar selection. This way, we can ensure everything fits within your budget while still providing an excellent experience.

Let me know your thoughts, and I can send over a detailed proposal including the adjusted pricing.

Best,
