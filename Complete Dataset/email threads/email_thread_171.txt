Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering services we offer for your upcoming wedding on June 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and are able to provide a menu tailored to your preferences.  

Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the specific dishes selected. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and all of our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can offer a selection of beverages for an extra fee.  

Please let me know if you would like to set up a time to discuss menu options or if you have any specific dietary requirements that we should consider.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. I would like to clarify if the mentioned price includes VAT, as well as if you could share some examples of the dishes you typically serve. My fiancé and I are leaning towards a mixed menu but would like to ensure we can accommodate some guests with gluten-free options.  

Additionally, could you provide more information about the cancellation policy? Given that weddings can be unpredictable, we want to make sure we are protected in case of any changes.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the final price. As for the menu, we can offer items such as herb-marinated chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free requests as well.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least 30 days prior to the event to avoid any penalties. If you have a specific number of guests in mind, we can finalize a menu and pricing for you.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification on the pricing and cancellation policy. After discussing with my fiancé, we would like to proceed with a final count of 120 guests and a mixed menu. We are happy with the price of $60 per person, excluding VAT, which brings the total to $7,200.  

Please confirm that this includes setup and staffing for the event. Once I hear back from you, I can provide a deposit to lock in the date.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best regards,
