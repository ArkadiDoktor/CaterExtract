Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher meals and can offer a diverse menu to accommodate various dietary preferences.  

For this event, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring selections such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of salads. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, and this includes full service with setup and staffing. Please let me know the expected number of guests, as we can accommodate anywhere from 50 to 200 attendees.  

All our meals are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet kosher standards. We also have options for vegetarian and gluten-free diets. Additionally, our pricing includes VAT, so there won’t be any unexpected charges.  

I look forward to your response so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the kosher certification and the variety of dietary options available. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, could you accommodate a lower price of $40 per person? We expect around 150 guests, which might help in coming to a favorable arrangement.  

Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in this price, or would they be provided separately?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your understanding and for providing the guest estimate. I can adjust the pricing to $42 per person for the 150 guests, which includes VAT. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in this price, but we can offer a selection of soft drinks and wines at an additional cost.  

If you would like, I can send over a beverage package that might suit your event. Please let me know if that works for you, and we can finalize the contract soon.  

Best,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I agree to the price of $42 per person for 150 guests, and I would like to proceed without the beverage package for now. We can handle that aspect separately. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience, including the cancellation terms.  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to working together to make this event a success.
