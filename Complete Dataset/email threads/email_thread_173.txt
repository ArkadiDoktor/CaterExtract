Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater for you.  

For an event of this nature, we typically recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which is set at $75. This price includes all food preparation, setup, and service staff. Please note that VAT will be added on top of this amount.  

We can comfortably accommodate a minimum of 80 guests and a maximum of 150. Additionally, we are able to provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Rabbinical Council, and we can offer several dietary options, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.  

If you are also interested in beverage service, we can provide a full bar package at an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your feedback!  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the mixed menu option and the kosher certification. Before we proceed, I wanted to clarify a couple of details.  

Is it possible to lower the per-person price, perhaps to $65? That would fit better within our budget. Also, could you confirm whether the bar service is included in the $75 price or if that's an entirely separate cost?  

Additionally, we're expecting around 120 guests, so I want to ensure we can finalize the arrangements soon.  

Thank you!  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your understanding regarding the pricing. While I cannot reduce the per-person rate to $65, I can offer a fixed price of $70 per person if we can secure the contract by the end of this week. This includes all setup and service but does not cover the bar service, which can be added for an additional $15 per person.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement. I look forward to your thoughts!  

Best,  
Michael

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility with the pricing. I would like to proceed with the offer of $70 per person for the catering, and I will include the bar service for an additional $15 per person. This brings us to a total of $85 per person, which is manageable for our budget.  

I will get the contract signed and sent over by Friday. Just to confirm, the cancellation policy you mentioned in your initial email allows for changes up until two weeks prior to the event, correct?  

Looking forward to working together.  

Best regards,  
Sarah
