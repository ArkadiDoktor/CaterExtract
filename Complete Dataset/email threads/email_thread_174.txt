I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist with the catering for your event.  

Our service typically includes a selection of gourmet dishes, with options ranging from meat to dairy, and we can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Additionally, our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary laws are observed. However, please note that beverages and bar service are not included in this pricing.  

If you would like, I can send over a sample menu for your review. Please let me know if you have any specific requests or questions.

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed price of $75 per person sounds reasonable, but considering our budget constraints, would you be open to negotiating down to $65 per person? We are expecting around 80 guests and would like to finalize the menu soon.  

I appreciate that the meals are kosher and under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Can you also provide some menu highlights? We want to ensure we have a diverse offering that caters to all our guests.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your offer and understand the need to stay within budget. I can agree to the price of $65 per person, as long as we maintain the minimum guest count of 50. For 80 guests, the total would be $5,200, which includes VAT.  

As for the menu, I would suggest a few highlights: herb-marinated roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can also include a dessert table featuring assorted pastries. If you decide to go with a bar service, we can discuss that separately.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best regards,

Could you please outline the cancellation policy and any additional notes regarding setup and staffing? I want to ensure everything is clear as we move forward.
