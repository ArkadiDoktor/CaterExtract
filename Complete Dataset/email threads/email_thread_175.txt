Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your upcoming charity gala on October 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. Our menu features a range of delicious options, including a selection of gourmet meat dishes, vegetarian choices, and delectable desserts, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.

For your event, our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a full dinner service. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and I can confirm that the pricing includes VAT. Additionally, we can offer a cash bar or a selection of beverages at an additional cost if you wish.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this proposal further.

Best regards,

Dear David,

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate that it adheres to kosher standards. However, I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person price includes any dietary accommodations for guests with allergies. Also, could you provide more information about the cancellation policy in case our plans change?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your questions. Yes, we can certainly accommodate dietary needs, including gluten-free and nut-free options, without any additional charge. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event date for any cancellations, after which a 50% fee will apply if canceled within that timeframe.

If you confirm the guest count at a minimum of 100, the total would be $7,500, which includes VAT. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.

Best regards,
