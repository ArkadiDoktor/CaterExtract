Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Mark Cohen, and I am reaching out from Gourmet Bites Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala scheduled for March 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can assist in making it a memorable occasion.  

We specialize in a variety of menu options, including kosher selections supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the menu choices and the number of guests, with a minimum requirement of 100 attendees. We can accommodate up to 300 guests if needed.  

Please let me know if you're interested, and we can set up a time to go over the details. I'd be happy to provide some sample menus for your review.  

Best regards,  
Mark Cohen

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The corporate gala is indeed a significant event for us, and I'm excited to explore options with Gourmet Bites. I appreciate the pricing range you've provided. However, I am looking for a fixed price per person to simplify our budgeting. Could you offer a specific menu option that fits within a $60 per person price point?  

Moreover, can you confirm whether the quoted prices include VAT? We are expecting around 150 guests, and I would like to ensure that dietary accommodations are available for some attendees with specific needs.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can certainly offer a fixed price of $60 per person, which includes a delightful mixed menu featuring options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet salads. This price does include VAT, so you won't need to worry about any additional charges.  

We can easily cater for 150 guests, and I assure you that we can accommodate various dietary needs, including gluten-free and vegan options. However, please note that our bar services would be separate from the catering package if you are interested in including beverages.  

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

I would like to proceed with the catering arrangement for 150 guests at the fixed price of $60 per person, including VAT. Please confirm that the kosher meals will be under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and let's discuss the bar options in a follow-up meeting.
