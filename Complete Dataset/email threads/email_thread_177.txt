Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on November 10th. We specialize in catering services that can accommodate a range of dietary preferences and are excited about the possibility of working with you.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring options like grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and gourmet salads. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We recommend planning for a minimum of 30 guests and can accommodate up to 100. We also provide staffing and all necessary equipment for the setup.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary needs or if you'd like to discuss this proposal further.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, but I would like to confirm if the meals are kosher and under what supervision they fall. Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in the $45 per person, or are they charged separately?  

I appreciate the information about the minimum guest requirement. We are expecting around 50 attendees, but I want to ensure that we can adjust if numbers change closer to the date.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick response. I can confirm that all our meals are kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union. The $45 per person does not include beverages, but we can offer a beverage package for an additional $10 per person if that works for you.  

Regarding the guest count, we can accommodate any changes up to five days before the event without any cancellation fees. If you decide to proceed with 50 guests, the total would be $2,250 including VAT.  

Please let me know if this meets your needs, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
