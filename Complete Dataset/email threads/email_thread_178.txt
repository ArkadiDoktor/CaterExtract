Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of Gourmet Delights to discuss your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in catering events like yours and would love to provide our services.  

For your event, we offer a selection of menus that can accommodate various preferences, including meat and dairy options. Our pricing starts at $45 per person for a full three-course meal, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT and covers all setup and staffing needed for the event. We can also tailor the menu to include vegetarian or gluten-free options based on your guests' dietary needs.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific requirements in mind.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've shared regarding the menu and pricing. Since we are expecting around 150 guests, I would like to know if you could provide us with a more detailed menu. We are particularly interested in ensuring that the food is kosher, so could you clarify if your offerings meet that requirement? Additionally, do you offer any beverage packages to complement the meal?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that our menu is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring compliance with all necessary dietary standards. For beverages, we can provide a bar package at an additional cost of $15 per person, including a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

The final price for the meal remains at $45 per person, and we can accommodate your guest count within the range you specified. Once we finalize the details, we require a 30% deposit to secure the booking, with cancellation terms allowing for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further questions.  

Best regards,
