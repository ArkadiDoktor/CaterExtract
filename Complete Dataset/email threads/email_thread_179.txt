Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to provide you with a catering proposal.  

We offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, designed to please a diverse audience. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a full buffet setup and staffing for the duration of the event. We can accommodate anywhere from 100 to 250 guests and are happy to provide dietary accommodations as needed.  

Additionally, we can offer kosher meals under supervision from the Orthodox Union. Please note that our prices are inclusive of VAT. However, beverages are not included in the initial pricing, but we can offer a bar package at an additional cost.  

If you have any specific preferences or requirements, feel free to share them. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The gala is indeed a significant event for our company, and I appreciate your willingness to work with us.  

I wanted to clarify a few details before we proceed. While the $75 per person sounds reasonable, we are aiming for a minimum of 150 guests, but we might go up to 200. Could you do a slight adjustment in the price if we confirm for 180 guests? Also, we would like to know if you can include a selection of non-alcoholic beverages in the package.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your quick reply. I understand the importance of accommodating your needs for the gala. For 180 guests, I can offer a revised price of $70 per person, which includes a selection of non-alcoholic beverages alongside the buffet.  

As for the menu, we can provide several highlights, including grilled chicken with rosemary, a vegetarian pasta option, and a seasonal salad. I hope this meets your expectations.  

Please let me know if this works for you, so we can move forward.
