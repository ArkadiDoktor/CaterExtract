Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to follow up on our recent conversation about catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services and create a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

Our pricing structure is typically based on a per person rate, which can range from $50 to $75 depending on the menu selections. We offer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options, and we can certainly accommodate various dietary restrictions upon request. Additionally, all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K organization.  

Regarding beverages, we can include a bar service for an additional fee or simply provide non-alcoholic drinks as part of the package. I would also like to mention that our pricing does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the final invoice.  

Please let me know your minimum and maximum guest count, and we can discuss the menu highlights. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the details provided. I appreciate the range in pricing, but I would like to clarify if there is any flexibility in the per person cost, as our budget is somewhat tight. We expect between 150 and 200 guests, and while I am interested in the mixed menu, I would like to see a sample menu to assess the options available.  

As for drinks, we would prefer to include a bar with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options, so please provide the associated costs. Finally, could you elaborate on the cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the need to work within a budget. I can offer a fixed price of $65 per person for a full-service catering package that includes a mixed menu, which will accommodate both meat and dairy preferences, along with a selection of appetizers and desserts.  

For the bar service, we can provide a full open bar at an additional $20 per person. As for the cancellation policy, we typically require notice at least one week prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made.  

I will send you a sample menu shortly so you can review the options. Please let me know if you have any more questions or if this pricing works for you.
