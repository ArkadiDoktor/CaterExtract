We can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests for this event, ensuring that we have enough staff and setup to meet your needs.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages for an extra charge. If you have specific menu items in mind, please let us know, and we can work to include them. Our cancellation policy allows for changes up to a week before the event.

Hi Daniel,  

I appreciate your quick response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds promising, but I would like to discuss a few adjustments. We are expecting around 80 guests, but we might go slightly higher. Could we consider a price reduction if we do reach the maximum capacity?  

Also, could you clarify what beverages would be included? We are mainly interested in having soft drinks and coffee, but I am not sure if that falls under your extra charge.  

Thanks for your assistance!

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. If we exceed 80 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person for every guest above that number, capping at the maximum of 100.  

Regarding beverages, our standard package includes soft drinks, water, and coffee, but it does not include any alcoholic beverages. If you are interested, we can provide a bar service for an additional fee.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
