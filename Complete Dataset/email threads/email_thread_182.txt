Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to explore the possibility of including a bar service. Additionally, could you clarify if the price includes beverages, or would that be a separate cost?  

We are aiming for around 100 guests, but I need to confirm the final count soon. The menu sounds great, but I would love to see some specific dish options that fit within that $75 price point.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. While our catering package does not include a bar service, we can certainly provide a beverage package for an additional $15 per person. This would cover a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

As for the menu, I can offer some delightful options such as herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads and desserts. I believe we can create a fantastic dining experience within your budget.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if there are any further adjustments you would like to discuss.  

Best regards,
