Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand that you are planning a wedding reception on May 15th for approximately 150 guests. We would love the opportunity to cater this special occasion.  

Our menu offers a variety of options, including a mix of meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For pricing, we generally charge $75 per person, which includes a full buffet setup, staff for service, and all necessary equipment. This price includes VAT. However, for larger events, we can discuss a fixed price that could be more cost-effective.  

Please let me know if you would like to explore our menu options further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Cohen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. I would like to confirm that the wedding will indeed be for 150 guests, but I am concerned about the pricing structure. Can we discuss the possibility of a fixed price for the whole event? Additionally, I would like to know if the bar service is included in your proposal.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I completely understand your concerns regarding pricing. For a fixed price option, we could set it at $10,500 for the entire event, which would cover the full buffet and staffing. Unfortunately, our bar service is not included in this price, but we can provide a selection of beverages at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you or if there are any other adjustments you would like to discuss.  

Warm regards,  
Daniel Cohen

Hi Daniel,  

Thanks for clarifying the pricing and the bar situation. After discussing with my team, we are ready to proceed with the fixed price of $10,500 for 150 guests as long as we can have the bar options discussed separately. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our needs. Please send over the contract and any other details we may need to finalize.  

Looking forward to working together to make this wedding a success.  

Best,
