Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in creating exquisite dining experiences and would love to cater your event, which I understand will host a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 150 guests.  

Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a beautiful selection of dishes and a dedicated staff for the evening. We can provide a diverse menu, featuring options such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a variety of gourmet salads. All our food is kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

However, please note that beverages are not included in the price, but we can certainly arrange a bar service if you wish to provide drinks for your guests. Additionally, we can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requirements in mind.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, I am concerned about the price, especially since we have a tight budget for this event. Would you be willing to negotiate the price to $65 per person? Also, could you clarify if the quoted price includes VAT?  

I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. I can agree to the price of $65 per person, and I can confirm that VAT is included in that amount. However, please keep in mind that the menu options would need to be slightly adjusted to accommodate this pricing.  

If you’re looking for specific dishes to include, we could offer options like chicken marsala and a selection of seasonal vegetables, along with a mixed salad. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
