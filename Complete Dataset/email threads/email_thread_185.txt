Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound appealing, especially the kosher meals. However, since we are expecting around 150 guests, could you confirm if the $45 per person also covers setup and staffing for the event? Additionally, we would like to know if beverages are included in this pricing.

Looking forward to your clarification.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your follow-up. The quoted price of $45 per person does include setup and staffing, but beverages are priced separately. We offer a variety of drink packages that can be tailored to your needs. If you'd like, I can send over the details. 

For a group of 150 guests, the total would come to $6,750. Please let me know if you would like to proceed, and I can finalize the menu and other details.

Best,
