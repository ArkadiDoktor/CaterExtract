Dear Hannah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for the wedding you are organizing on March 15th. We specialize in creating delightful culinary experiences and would be thrilled to assist you with this special event.  

For weddings, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring a variety of dishes to please all guests. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and can serve up to 150. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we offer a selection of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

I would love to discuss your preferences in more detail and provide a representative menu based on your vision. Looking forward to your response.  

Warm regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response and for providing the initial details. I appreciate your flexibility in accommodating dietary needs. However, I'm wondering if there is any room for negotiation on the price per person, as we are working within a budget. Additionally, can you clarify if beverages are included in that price, or would they be an additional cost?  

Please let me know how we might move forward on this.  

Best,

Dear Hannah,  

Thank you for your reply and for your interest in our catering services. I understand the importance of staying within budget. While I cannot lower the price significantly, I can offer a package that includes a selection of non-alcoholic beverages at no extra cost. Alcoholic beverages would still be an additional charge if you decide to include them in your event.  

If we proceed with the current offer at $75 per person, which includes a diverse menu with options such as braised short ribs, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of desserts, we can finalize the details. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best regards,
