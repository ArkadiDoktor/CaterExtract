Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing looks reasonable, but I wanted to confirm if that $75 per person includes VAT. Additionally, we are considering a full bar for the evening; does your proposal include beverages, or would that be a separate arrangement?  

I would appreciate it if you could share a sample menu as well, particularly focusing on any vegetarian options you might have.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. Unfortunately, our current proposal does not include a bar; we can recommend a nearby service that specializes in beverage catering if you like.  

I will send over a sample menu shortly, highlighting our vegetarian options. Additionally, we can accommodate gluten-free and nut-free requests if you have any guests with dietary restrictions.  

Let me know if you have any other questions.  

Best,

I have reviewed everything, and I would like to proceed with your catering for 100 guests at the agreed price of $75 per person, excluding VAT. Please prepare a formal agreement including the cancellation policy and any other details needed for our records.  

I look forward to working with you to make this event a success.
