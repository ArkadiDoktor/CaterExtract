Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us about catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals and excellent service for such special occasions. For this event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, with an emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients.  

Our pricing starts at 45 per person and can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests. All prices are inclusive of VAT, and we can certainly provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. We can also arrange for a full bar service, though beverages are not included in the base price.  

If you have any specific dietary requirements or menu items in mind, please let me know. I look forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, but I would like to clarify a couple of details. Can you provide a sample menu and confirm if there are options for vegetarian guests? Additionally, I noticed the starting price is 45 per person. Is there any flexibility in pricing if we finalize a larger number of guests?  

Lastly, what are your cancellation terms should anything change on our end? I appreciate your help!  

Warm regards,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can certainly accommodate vegetarian options, and our sample menu includes items like roasted vegetable lasagna and quinoa salad. Regarding pricing, if you confirm 150 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of 42 per person. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event date.  

Once we finalize the details, I can send over the complete menu and any additional information you may need.  

Best,

Please confirm that this includes VAT and that the menu will include both the vegetarian options and the kosher supervision as discussed.  

I look forward to finalizing the agreement and would appreciate receiving the contract at your earliest convenience.
