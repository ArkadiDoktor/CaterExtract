Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering options for your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for October 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals and a range of dietary accommodations, and I believe we can offer an exceptional experience for your guests.  

For a group of 50 to 150 attendees, our pricing starts at $55 per person, which includes a selection of mixed courses featuring both meat and vegetarian options. We can certainly provide kosher meals under the supervision of Rabbi Cohen, ensuring all dietary needs are met. Please note that our prices include VAT.  

Additionally, we can offer a bar service for an extra cost, or you can choose to arrange it separately. Our menu highlights include herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable medley, and a decadent chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requirements. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for outlining your initial proposal. The gala dinner sounds exciting, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to lower the price to $50 per person? We expect around 80 guests, but we might go up to 120 depending on the final RSVP count.  

Also, could you confirm whether the bar service is included in that pricing or if it would be an additional charge? Lastly, do you have any gluten-free options available?  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of staying within budget, and I can revise the price to $52 per person for your event. This would still include the kosher meals under Rabbi Cohen's supervision, along with VAT. The bar service would be an additional $15 per person, but I can offer a selection of non-alcoholic beverages included in the initial price.  

We are happy to accommodate gluten-free options as well, such as quinoa salad and grilled chicken. I hope this works for you, and I am more than willing to assist with any additional requests you may have to ensure a successful event.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

I appreciate your flexibility with the pricing and the accommodations for gluten-free options. I am happy to accept your revised offer of $52 per person for 80 guests, which brings us to a total of $4,160. Please confirm that the bar service will be an additional $15 per person, which we will handle separately.  

I would also like to confirm that our cancellation policy allows for changes up to one week before the event. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience, and we can finalize everything.  

Thank you again for your cooperation.  

Best,
