Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights to cater your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I believe we can offer a menu that will impress your guests.  

For your event, we typically recommend a mixed menu, which includes a selection of both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests required. This price includes VAT, and we can also accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss menu options further or if you have any specific requests. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The mixed menu sounds great, but I want to clarify if the price is fixed at $75 per person for up to 100 guests, or if there is a range depending on the final headcount. Additionally, could you confirm whether the food is kosher and the level of supervision?  

I am also considering adding a bar service for the event. Would that be included in the package, or would it be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The pricing of $75 per person is indeed fixed for up to 100 guests, and we can accommodate a maximum of 150 guests if needed. I can confirm that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards.  

Regarding the bar, it is not included in the base price, but we can provide an open bar service at an additional cost of $30 per person. If you choose to go ahead with our catering, we will provide a detailed menu that includes highlights such as herb-roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads.  

Please let me know if this fits your needs, and we can move forward.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the details. I appreciate the clarification on the pricing and kosher supervision. I would like to proceed with the catering for our corporate gala on March 15th, confirming 100 guests at $75 per person. Additionally, I would like to add the open bar service at $30 per person.  

This brings the total to $10,500, including VAT. I understand the cancellation policy allows for changes up to one week prior to the event. Please send over a contract for my review.
