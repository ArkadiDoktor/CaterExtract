Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events like yours, and I believe we can create a delightful experience for your guests.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which typically ranges from $50 to $75, depending on the menu selections you choose. We offer a variety of options, including meat and mixed dishes, and can accommodate dietary restrictions as needed. All our food is kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

I would love to discuss your vision for the event and any specific menu items you have in mind. Please let me know a suitable time for us to chat.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the range you provided. I am considering approximately 150 guests for the gala, but I would like to confirm if there's a minimum guest requirement. Additionally, can you clarify if the prices you mentioned include VAT?  

While I am interested in a mixed menu, I would like to keep the cost closer to $50 per person. Would it be possible to create a menu at that price point? Also, could you let me know if beverages are included in that pricing?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. We can cater to a minimum of 100 guests, which fits well with your estimate. The pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final amount.  

I can certainly work on a menu that fits your budget of $50 per person. For beverages, we typically offer a separate bar package, but I can explore options for including non-alcoholic drinks with the meal. Some highlights from our menu include herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable quinoa, and a selection of seasonal salads.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there are any specific dietary accommodations we should consider.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thanks for the clarifications. I would like to confirm our agreement for 150 guests at $50 per person, bringing the total to $7,500, excluding VAT. I appreciate you accommodating our dietary needs and including a selection of non-alcoholic beverages.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience. I understand the cancellation policy allows for any changes up to two weeks before the event, which works for us.  

I look forward to finalizing this arrangement.
