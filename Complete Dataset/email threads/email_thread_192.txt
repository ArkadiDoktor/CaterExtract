Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $65 per person price point is within our budget, but I would like to clarify if that includes beverages as well. We might consider a bar setup depending on the cost. Additionally, could you confirm whether your meals are kosher, and under what supervision?  

I’m looking forward to seeing the proposed menu, especially any highlights you might recommend.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your quick reply. The price of $65 per person does not include a bar, but we can certainly assist with beverage options if you're interested. Our meals are kosher and are supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Regarding the menu, I suggest including our signature brisket and a delightful selection of seasonal vegetables, which have received great feedback in the past. Please let me know if you would like to see a complete menu for your review.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Warm regards,
