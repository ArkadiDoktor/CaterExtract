Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our catering services for this event. Our menu features a delightful selection of dishes that can cater to various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For the gala, we typically recommend a mixed menu, which includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, starting at $75, which includes VAT. This price covers a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests.  

Please let me know if you have any specific menu preferences or if you require additional services, such as staffing and setup. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the pricing details you provided. I am particularly interested in the mixed menu you mentioned, but I would like to confirm whether the dishes are kosher, as some of our guests will require that. Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 per person price includes drinks or if I need to arrange those separately?  

If everything aligns well, we expect to have around 100 guests for the event. Please let me know about the kosher supervision and any other dietary accommodations you can offer.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that our menu is indeed kosher and under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. The price of $75 per person does not include beverages; however, we can provide a bar package starting at an additional $20 per person if that would be of interest.  

Considering your expected guest count of 100, the full catering cost would be $7,500, including VAT. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions with options for vegan and gluten-free meals. In terms of cancellation, we require notice at least two weeks prior to the event to avoid any charges.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,

I understand the cancellation policy, and I'm happy with everything discussed.  

Please prepare the contract, and I will review it promptly. Looking forward to working together to make this gala a success.
