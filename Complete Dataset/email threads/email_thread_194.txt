Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special event. Our menu can be tailored to meet your needs, featuring a delightful selection of dishes that include options suitable for various dietary restrictions.  

We typically charge $50 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. This price includes VAT. Our offerings can be kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes. We also offer beverage packages but would need to discuss whether you prefer a full bar or just non-alcoholic options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests in mind.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The information you provided sounds promising. I appreciate the option for a mixed menu and the kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union, as this is important for our guests. I would like to clarify if the $50 per person includes both food and beverages or if that is strictly for the meal.  

Additionally, we may have closer to 180 guests, so I would like to know if you can accommodate that number and what adjustments might be needed. Lastly, could you outline your cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The pricing of $50 per person covers the food only. We can certainly provide beverage options, and I can send you a list of package prices for that. For 180 guests, we can accommodate you, but I would recommend confirming soon, as our availability is limited.  

Regarding cancellation, we require a notice of at least 30 days prior to the event for a full refund. I hope this addresses your questions, and I am happy to discuss any specific menu items or adjustments you might want.  

Best wishes,
