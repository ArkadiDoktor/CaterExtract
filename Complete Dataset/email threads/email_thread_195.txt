Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala event on November 15. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this occasion. Our offerings include a diverse selection of dishes suitable for a formal gathering, featuring both meat and dairy options.  

We typically charge $50 per person, which includes a full buffet setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. Our pricing is inclusive of VAT, so there won’t be any surprises on the final invoice. We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests, and we also have options for dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free meals.  

Regarding kosher supervision, we can provide meals certified by the Orthodox Union. Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu further or have any specific requests.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and detailed information. I appreciate the pricing structure and the inclusion of VAT. However, I was hoping to confirm if you could offer a more budget-friendly option for a minimum of 150 guests, as our budget is quite tight. Additionally, could you specify whether beverages are included in the package or if they would be an extra cost?  

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hi Rachel,  

I completely understand the need for budget considerations. We can adjust the package to $45 per person for a minimum of 150 guests, which still includes the buffet setup and staff. Beverages, however, would need to be added separately; we can provide a selection of soft drinks and a cash bar if you prefer.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a draft contract including the menu options.  

Warm regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your flexibility and the revised pricing. I would like to proceed with the adjusted package of $45 per person for 150 guests. Please include the selection of soft drinks in the final contract, and I’d appreciate a list of menu highlights when you send it over. I understand your cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to a week before the event, which works for us.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details.  

Best,
