Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a few details. Can you confirm if the food is kosher? If so, what supervision do you have in place? Additionally, we are considering a guest list that may go up to 200, and I’d appreciate a revised quote if we exceed 150 attendees.  

Lastly, could you let me know if the menu can include some vegetarian options? I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, all our food is kosher and supervised by the OK kosher certification. We can certainly provide vegetarian options within the same pricing structure.  

If your guest count goes beyond 150, we can still accommodate up to 200 guests, with a revised price of $42 per person for the additional attendees. All prices include VAT.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a detailed menu for your review.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I am happy to confirm the catering for 200 guests at the revised price of $42 per person, bringing the total to $8,400. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu options and the kosher supervision.  

Please prepare a detailed menu and any additional notes regarding setup and staffing. I understand the cancellation policy is 30 days prior to the event, which is acceptable. Looking forward to working with you!
