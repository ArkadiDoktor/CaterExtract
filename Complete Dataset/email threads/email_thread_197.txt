Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our team is experienced in catering events of this nature, and we pride ourselves on offering high-quality cuisine tailored to your needs.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we typically charge $50 per person, which includes a variety of dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK. The menu we offer is mixed, featuring options such as grilled salmon, chicken marsala, and a selection of vegetarian dishes. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Beverages, including soft drinks and water, will be provided, but a full bar service would be an additional cost. Please note that our pricing includes VAT, and we have flexible cancellation terms, allowing for changes up to one week before the event.  

Let me know if you have any specific requests or would like to adjust the guest count. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to lower the cost a bit since we are working within a tight budget. Would you be able to offer a price closer to $45 per person for 120 guests? Additionally, could you clarify if the beverages are included in the initial price?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to manage costs. I can reduce the price to $47 per person for 120 guests. This price still includes the mixed menu and beverages, but please note that if you want a full bar, that would be an extra charge.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,  
Michael
