Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our standard offering includes a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

We typically charge $45 per person, inclusive of VAT. Our services can accommodate between 50 and 200 guests, and we also provide options for dietary accommodations such as gluten-free and vegetarian dishes. While we do not include a bar in our standard package, we can arrange beverage services upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any specific requirements in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to work within a tighter budget. Would you be able to lower the price to $40 per person while still providing a similar menu? Additionally, since we expect approximately 150 guests, could you confirm whether the VAT is included in that price?  

I’d also like to clarify if the kosher supervision covers all the food items you plan to serve. Finally, could you provide more details on the menu highlights?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. I can offer the price of $40 per person, and this does include VAT. The kosher supervision will cover all dishes in the proposed menu.  

For the highlights, we typically offer options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet salads. Additionally, I can provide a separate beverage package if you decide to include drinks for your guests.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Please prepare the herb-roasted chicken and grilled vegetable platters as discussed. I would also like to include a beverage package for our guests. If everything is in place, I would appreciate a written confirmation of our agreement along with the cancellation policy.  

Thank you once again for your assistance.
