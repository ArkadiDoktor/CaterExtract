Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with the culinary arrangements. Our standard menu offers a variety of options suitable for various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free choices.  

We typically charge a fixed price of $50 per person, which includes all food items, setup, and staffing. For your event, we can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests. Please note that our pricing does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%.  

Additionally, we offer kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Rabbinical Council, with a mixed menu featuring meat and dairy options. However, beverages would be excluded from this pricing.  

I would love to discuss the details further to ensure we meet your needs perfectly.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the quick response. I appreciate the details provided. I would like to clarify a few points before we proceed. The number of guests may potentially reach 250, so could you accommodate that? Also, is there flexibility in the price if we were to increase the guest count?  

While I understand the kosher supervision, could you give me more insight into the specific menu items available? I am particularly interested in options that cater to both meat and dairy preferences.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your follow-up. We can indeed accommodate up to 250 guests, but the pricing would shift to $45 per person for that number. This includes VAT, which simplifies the overall budgeting.  

As for the menu, I recommend our grilled chicken with roasted vegetables, beef brisket, and a selection of dairy-based desserts like cheesecake and tiramisu. We can adjust the menu based on your preferences and any dietary needs you may have.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.  

Best,
