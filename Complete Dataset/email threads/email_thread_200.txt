Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on December 15th and are in need of catering services. We specialize in a variety of cuisines, including kosher options, and can provide a menu tailored to your event.  

For our catering services, we typically charge a fixed price of $50 per person for a mixed menu, which includes a selection of meat and vegetarian dishes. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and our pricing includes VAT. All our kosher meals are supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring compliance with dietary laws.  

Additionally, we can provide a beverage package at an extra cost, should you require drinks for your guests. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests for the menu.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. I appreciate your flexibility in accommodating our event's needs. The price per person seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there is room for negotiation, considering we might have around 150 guests.  

Also, could you clarify if the beverage package includes a bar setup or if that would be an additional expense? We are hoping to finalize our catering arrangements soon, so any details you can provide would be very helpful.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concern about the pricing, and I'm happy to offer a revised rate of $45 per person for 150 guests. This price still includes VAT and covers a full mixed menu. The beverage package does not include a bar setup, but we can offer a separate bar service for an additional fee.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and if you have any specific menu items in mind, I would be glad to accommodate dietary needs as well.  

Warm regards,  
David Cohen
