Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify a couple of things. Could you provide a few examples of the dishes included in the mixed menu? Additionally, while we anticipate around 100 guests, we might have a few more. Would you be able to adjust the price if we exceed the minimum of 50?  

Also, does the $75 per person include beverages, or should we plan for a separate bar arrangement?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For the mixed menu, we typically include items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of seasonal salads. If your guest count exceeds 100, we can certainly adjust the price to $70 per person for any additional guests beyond the minimum.  

Regarding beverages, the $75 per person does not include a bar. However, we can arrange a full bar service for an additional $30 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Please let me know your thoughts, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the detailed information. I would like to move forward with the catering arrangement for 100 guests, including the mixed menu and the bar service. That brings the total to $10,000.  

I understand the cancellation policy is standard, allowing cancellation up to two weeks before the event with a full refund. I will ensure everything is confirmed on our end and notify you in case of any changes.  

Looking forward to working together!  

Best regards,
