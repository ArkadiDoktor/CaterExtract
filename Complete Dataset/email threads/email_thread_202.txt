Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We're looking to host the event on the 15th of next month, and I'm pleased to hear about your kosher offerings. However, I would like to know if your price of thirty-five dollars per person includes drinks, as we are considering whether to include a bar service. Additionally, if we decide to go ahead, could you confirm the cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The thirty-five dollars per person does not include bar service, but we can arrange a beverage package for an additional ten dollars per person. Regarding the cancellation policy, we ask for a two-week notice prior to the event for a full refund. If you need to cancel within that time frame, we can offer a credit towards a future event instead.  

If you are ready to proceed, I can finalize the menu and send over a formal agreement.  

Best,
