Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on June 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you.  

We offer a delicious menu featuring a variety of options, including meat, dairy, and vegetarian selections. Our pricing is structured at $50 per person, and we recommend a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum capacity of 150. This price includes all necessary setup and staffing, as well as VAT.  

Our dishes can be catered to accommodate dietary restrictions, and we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. However, please note that beverages are not included in this pricing but can be arranged separately.  

I would be happy to send over a sample menu for your review. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or additional questions.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details about your catering options. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few things. While I appreciate the $50 per person rate, could you possibly accommodate a lower price if we were to confirm for 100 guests?  

Additionally, could you provide more details on the menu items? Specifically, I am interested in seeing some of the meat and vegetarian options you offer. Finally, can you confirm whether the pricing includes the bar service, or if that would be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick response. For a confirmed guest count of 100, we can reduce the price to $45 per person. This would bring the total to $4,500, and VAT is included in that amount.  

Regarding the menu, we offer a selection of mouth-watering dishes, including herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of gourmet salads. Unfortunately, the bar service is an add-on, starting at $15 per person for a standard selection of drinks.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I'll send over a detailed menu for your review.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the revised pricing and the information on the menu. I’m pleased with the $4,500 total for 100 guests, and I would like to confirm our order. Please prepare the kosher options under the Orthodox Union supervision and include a selection of the meat dishes mentioned.  

I will handle the bar service separately, so please exclude that from the final agreement. Can we discuss the cancellation policy before we finalize everything?  

Thank you, and I look forward to working together.
