Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to cater for you. Based on the information you've provided, we typically offer a range of menu options that can include meat, dairy, or a mixed selection. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. 

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which starts at $45 and can vary depending on your selected menu items. We ensure that all our food is prepared under kosher supervision, specifically by the Orthodox Union. Please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions, as we can accommodate options such as gluten-free and vegetarian.

Additionally, our service package includes setup and staffing, but beverages would need to be arranged separately. We also include VAT in our pricing.  

I look forward to your feedback and any specific requests you might have.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I am considering a mixed menu, but I would like to know if you could offer a bit more variety on the meat options. Also, could you confirm if the $45 per person includes all the menu items or if some are at an additional charge? 

Given that we're expecting around 100 guests, I want to ensure everything fits within our budget. If we go ahead, what would be your cancellation policy?  

Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. I'm glad to hear you're leaning towards a mixed menu. For the $45 per person, that would cover a selection of our standard offerings, including options like herb-roasted chicken and a seasonal vegetable medley. If you'd like to add premium items like filet mignon, those would be an additional charge. 

Regarding your question on cancellation, we typically require notice of at least 14 days before the event for a full refund. If you cancel later than that, we retain a 30% deposit. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to finalize the details.  

Best,
