Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Culinary Delights regarding your upcoming wedding reception scheduled for March 15, 2024. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your special day. Our team specializes in creating memorable culinary experiences, and we offer a diverse menu that includes both meat and dairy options to accommodate various dietary preferences.  

For events like yours, we typically recommend a package priced at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This pricing is based on a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests, ensuring a delightful experience for all. Please note that VAT is included in this price.  

We also offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a range of beverages, including a full bar, at an additional cost. If you have any specific dietary requirements, please let us know, and we will be happy to accommodate them.  

Looking forward to your response to discuss further details!

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the quick response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the flexibility in accommodating our guest count. However, we were hoping to keep our budget closer to $60 per person. Is there any way to adjust the menu or some of the offerings to meet this price point?  

Also, we would like to ensure that the menu includes vegetarian options alongside the meat dishes. Please confirm if your kosher supervision would apply to the vegetarian items as well.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply and for sharing your budgetary needs. I understand the importance of staying within budget, and I'm happy to work with you. We can adjust the menu to offer a selection of appetizers, a couple of main course options, and desserts for $60 per person while still providing quality dishes. The vegetarian options will indeed be under the same kosher supervision.  

If we proceed with this adjustment, the final price for 100 guests would be $6,000, which includes VAT. Please remember that our cancellation policy allows for changes up to one month before the event.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details!
