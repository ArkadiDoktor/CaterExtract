Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate seminar scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in a variety of menu types, and I believe we can create a memorable dining experience for your attendees.  

For this event, we typically propose a mixed menu, featuring both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing structure is set at 45 dollars per person, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT, and of course, we can accommodate dietary needs, including gluten-free and vegetarian options.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, but alcohol is not included in the package. If you prefer, we could arrange for a bar service at an additional cost. Our team would also handle setup and staffing to ensure everything runs smoothly.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and if you have any specific requests or questions. I look forward to working together to make your event a success.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the catering options. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points regarding your proposal. While I appreciate the mixed menu, we would prefer to have kosher options available for our guests. Can you confirm whether your dishes are kosher and what supervision you follow?  

Also, while I understand the beverages are extra, could you provide a rough estimate for a bar service if we choose to include that? Lastly, is there any flexibility on the minimum guest count? We may have a few more guests than anticipated, depending on confirmations.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can confirm that our dishes can be prepared under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority, ensuring that all food is kosher. Regarding the bar service, we typically charge around 15 dollars per person for a standard package that includes beer, wine, and soft drinks.  

As for the guest count, we can accommodate an increase to a minimum of 75 guests if necessary, but the pricing would remain the same for up to 200 guests. This gives you some flexibility if your numbers rise.  

Please let me know if this meets your needs, and I would be happy to finalize the details.  

Best wishes,

In terms of cancellation, please confirm your policy, and if everything can be finalized, I will send over the deposit.
