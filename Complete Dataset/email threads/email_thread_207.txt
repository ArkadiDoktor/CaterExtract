Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming conference scheduled for April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for corporate events. 

For your gathering, we can offer a range of menu options including mixed cuisine that can accommodate various dietary restrictions. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $50 per person, which includes an assortment of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests, ensuring a diverse selection for everyone. 

Please note that our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK, and we can also offer gluten-free and vegan options upon request. Additionally, our service includes setup and staffing for the duration of the event. 

I would love to discuss this further and work towards finalizing the details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify if the $50 per person price includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, could you confirm whether beverages are included in the package?  

Also, we anticipate around 120 guests, and it would be great to know more about the specific menu items you can provide. Could you suggest a few highlights?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The pricing of $50 per person does include VAT, so there will be no additional charges in that regard. Beverages are not included in the initial package, but we can offer a bar service for an additional fee per guest. 

As for menu highlights, we could feature a delicious herb-roasted chicken, a vegetarian stuffed bell pepper, and a selection of seasonal desserts. I can provide a full menu for your review if that would help.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the arrangements.  

Best,

Thank you for the clarification on the pricing and menu details. I appreciate the options you've provided. I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests at the agreed price of $50 per person, which comes to a total of $6,000. Please prepare the contracts with the understanding that the cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event.  

Let’s also include the bar service for an additional fee, so I would like to discuss those details as well. I look forward to your confirmation.
