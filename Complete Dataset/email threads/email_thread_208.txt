Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you are in need of catering services for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to your needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes various options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of seasonal salads. Our pricing structure is set at $35 per person, which includes full service and setup. Please note that we cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. Our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all necessary dietary requirements.  

Additionally, we can discuss beverage options, including a bar setup, if you would like. All prices are inclusive of VAT. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary restrictions or preferences, and I will be happy to accommodate them.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the details. The menu sounds great, but I was hoping to get the price down a bit. Would you be able to offer a discount if we decide to go with 75 guests instead of the minimum? Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the $35 per person, or would that be an extra charge?  

I appreciate your attention to dietary needs, and I will get back to you shortly with any specific requests.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. For 75 guests, I can reduce the price to $32 per person, which will still include the full service and setup. As for the bar service, that would be an additional charge of $15 per person, but I can provide a non-alcoholic beverage option for free with the meal if that suits your needs.  

Let me know if this revised proposal works for you, and I can send over a formal contract.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for adjusting the pricing. I would like to confirm the catering for 75 guests at the rate of $32 per person, which will bring the total to $2,400. I agree to the additional $15 per person for the bar service as well. Please include non-alcoholic beverage options in the package.  

I will review the dietary needs and send those over soon. Also, could you clarify your cancellation terms? I appreciate your assistance and look forward to working together on this event.  

Best,
