Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming gala dinner on October 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would be thrilled to assist with your event.  

For a gathering of between 50 and 150 guests, we offer a delicious mixed menu that includes options like herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet desserts. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes all meal preparation, setup, and staffing. Please note that VAT is included in this price.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union if needed. Should you require a bar service, we can discuss that as an add-on. We can accommodate specific dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The menu you suggested sounds fantastic. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of things before moving forward.  

We are expecting around 100 guests, so I appreciate the pricing structure. Would you be able to offer a slight discount if we confirm the booking by the end of this week? Additionally, could you please confirm if the bar service is a separate charge and what the options would be?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your interest in our catering services. I’m glad you liked the menu options. If you confirm the booking by the end of this week, I can offer a discount, bringing the price down to $40 per person for your 100 guests.  

Regarding the bar service, it is indeed an additional charge, but I can provide a range of options based on your preferences. We can discuss whether you prefer a selection of wines, a full bar, or just non-alcoholic beverages.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,
