Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would be thrilled to contribute to your event.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we can offer a mixed menu that includes options such as herb-roasted chicken, seasonal vegetable risotto, and gourmet salads. Our pricing structure is set at $65 per person, which includes all food preparation and service staff. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT.  

We are proud to offer kosher food supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary needs are met. Additionally, we can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free requests. As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our packages, but we can arrange for a beverage service at an additional cost.  

I would be happy to discuss the details further and answer any questions you might have. Looking forward to your response.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, our budget is slightly tighter than anticipated. Would you be open to a reduced rate of $60 per person for a minimum of 100 guests? If we can agree on this, we can finalize the arrangements today.  

Additionally, could you clarify whether the $65 price includes VAT or if it is added on top? I am also interested in knowing more about the setup and staff available for the event.  

Thanks again for your help, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing. I can meet you at the $60 per person rate for a minimum of 100 guests, but this will still not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. Regarding the setup, we provide all necessary equipment and staff for the event, ensuring everything runs smoothly.  

If you would like to proceed with our offer, I can confirm a final price of $6,000 for 100 guests, including setup and service. Please let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare the contract.  

Looking forward to your decision.  

Best,  
Michael
