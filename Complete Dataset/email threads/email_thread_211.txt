Hi Ethan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. However, I was hoping to clarify a few things. While I find the $75 per person rate reasonable, I would like to know if this includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, could you provide more information about the bar service? We are considering offering a full bar, and I want to ensure that it can be included in the overall package.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $75 per person does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. Regarding the bar service, we can certainly include a selection of beverages for an additional $15 per person, or you may opt for a full bar at $25 per person.  

Please let me know what you prefer, along with any dietary restrictions we should consider, so we can finalize the menu and adjust our proposal accordingly.  

Best,

Hi Ethan,  

Thank you for the clarification regarding the pricing and bar options. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the $75 per person rate, plus the $25 for the full bar, which totals $100 per person. We will also require kosher supervision, which is fantastic that you can provide.  

Please confirm that this includes all necessary setup and staffing for the event. I look forward to receiving the final contract.
