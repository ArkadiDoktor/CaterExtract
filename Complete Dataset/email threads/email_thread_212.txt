Hi David,

Thank you for your quick response. The menu you proposed sounds delicious, but I wanted to clarify a few details. We anticipate around 80 guests, and I would like to ensure the food is kosher, as some of our attendees observe dietary restrictions. Can you confirm the kosher supervision under which your meals are prepared? 

Additionally, could you provide more information about whether beverages are included in the package? I am also curious about your cancellation policy in case our plans change.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your follow-up questions. I can confirm that our meals are indeed kosher, prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We can also provide a selection of beverages, including soft drinks and coffee, for an additional $10 per person.

Regarding the cancellation policy, you can cancel up to two weeks before the event without any penalty. After that, a 50% charge will apply. 

If you would like to proceed, I can finalize the total at $3,600 for 80 guests, including VAT and the beverage package. Please let me know if this works for you.

Best,  
David
