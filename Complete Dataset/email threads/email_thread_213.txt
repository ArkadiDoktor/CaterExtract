Dear Hannah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater this occasion for you. Our standard offering includes a mixed menu to accommodate various dietary preferences, including options for vegetarian and gluten-free guests.  

We typically price our services at £30 per person, which includes a three-course meal and setup. For a group of 50 to 100 guests, this would be a fixed price, and VAT is included in this amount. We also provide staff for the duration of the event to ensure everything runs smoothly.  

Please let me know if you have any specific requests or dietary restrictions we should be aware of. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
James Thompson

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the comprehensive menu options you mentioned. However, I wanted to clarify whether the meal can be kosher, as some of our guests require it. Additionally, could you provide more details about the menu highlights?  

If we were to settle on 75 guests, would you be willing to discuss the pricing? I am looking for a little flexibility, perhaps around £25 per person. I understand this might be a negotiation, but it would really help us fit this into our budget.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Hannah

Hi Hannah,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the kosher requirements. We can certainly provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din. In terms of menu highlights, we can offer options such as herb-crusted salmon, stuffed peppers, and a delightful chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Regarding the pricing, I can offer you a reduced rate of £28 per person for 75 guests, with VAT included. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a bar service as part of this package, but I can recommend a local service if needed.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the arrangements.  

Best wishes,  
James

Hi James,  

Thank you for accommodating the kosher meals and for the menu details; they sound fantastic. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the pricing as well. I would like to confirm the catering for 75 guests at £28 per person, which comes to a total of £2,100, inclusive of VAT.  

We are excited to have Gourmet Catering Services as part of our event on November 15th. Please let me know the next steps for the contract and any deposit required. I also want to confirm that the cancellation policy is flexible, as we might need to adjust numbers closer to the date.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best regards,  
Hannah
