Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for the corporate event you're planning on March 15th at the Grand Hotel. We specialize in providing quality food for such occasions and would love to assist you.  

For a gathering of this nature, we can offer a mixed menu featuring gourmet meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a full buffet, staff for setup and service, and all necessary equipment. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our prices include VAT.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific dietary requirements in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. I appreciate the inclusion of VAT in your pricing. However, I was hoping to explore options to reduce the per-person cost, as we are expecting around 120 guests and aiming to stay within budget. Would you be open to negotiating the price if we choose a simpler menu?  

Also, could you clarify whether beverages are included in your proposal? We are looking for a no-alcohol bar setup if possible.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of staying within budget, and I can offer a simpler menu at a reduced price of $40 per person. This will still include a variety of delicious options, along with the necessary service staff.  

Regarding your question, beverages are not included in the initial proposal. However, we can provide a selection of soft drinks and juices for an additional $10 per person. Please let me know if this works for you, or if you have any other requests.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your flexibility and for adjusting the menu pricing. The new offer of $40 per person sounds reasonable, and I appreciate the option for beverages at an additional cost. I would like to confirm the catering for 120 guests on March 15th with the simpler mixed menu, including drinks.  

Please send over the contract with the cancellation policy when you can, and let me know if you need any further details from my end.  

Best regards,
