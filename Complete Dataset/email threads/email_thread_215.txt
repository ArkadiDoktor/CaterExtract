For this event, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes all necessary staffing and equipment. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Our food is under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring adherence to the highest standards.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. The mixed menu sounds excellent, and I appreciate the kosher supervision detail. Before we proceed, could you clarify if the $45 per person price includes VAT? Additionally, we are considering a beverage bar for the event. Is that included in your package or would it be an additional cost?  

I would also like to know what dietary accommodations you can provide, particularly for gluten-free options.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person price does not include VAT, which will be added on top. Regarding the beverage bar, we can include a standard selection of drinks for an additional $15 per person, which covers soft drinks and basic cocktails. We are happy to accommodate gluten-free requests as well, ensuring that everyone has suitable options to enjoy.  

If you have a specific number of guests in mind, please let me know, and I can provide a more detailed proposal.  

Best wishes,
