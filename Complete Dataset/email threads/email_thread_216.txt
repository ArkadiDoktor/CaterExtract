Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for December 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our team specializes in creating memorable dining experiences and can offer a diverse menu tailored to your needs.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we usually recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring a variety of tastes are catered to. Our pricing structure typically starts at 45 per person, with all meals prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Please note that VAT is included in this pricing.  

Additionally, we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. While we can provide a full bar service, this would be at an additional cost. I would be happy to send over a sample menu and discuss your preferences further.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is an exciting opportunity for us, and I appreciate your suggestions. I would like to confirm the guest count and explore if we could adjust the per person rate to accommodate a tighter budget. Would you be able to offer a reduced rate for 120 guests instead?  

Also, could you clarify if the quoted price includes beverages, as we are considering a dry event? Additionally, we would like to ensure that the menu includes some vegan options for our guests with dietary restrictions.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand your concern about the budget, and I can offer a revised rate of 42 per person for 120 guests, which brings the total to 5,040. This price includes VAT, but please note that the bar service will remain a separate charge if you wish to include it.  

As for the menu, we can certainly add vegan options and ensure that all dishes remain kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. I will send over a detailed menu proposal shortly.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.
