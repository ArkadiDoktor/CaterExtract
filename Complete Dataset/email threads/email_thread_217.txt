We would be thrilled to cater your event, offering a diverse menu tailored to your guests' preferences. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, with our packages starting at $75 per person. This includes a three-course meal and coffee service. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to explore if there’s any flexibility, especially since we are considering a guest list closer to 150. Additionally, could you confirm if the $75 price includes VAT?  

I am also interested in knowing more about the menu options. We want to ensure there are vegetarian and gluten-free choices available. Lastly, does your service include beverages, or would that be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your clarifications.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thanks for your questions. I can certainly offer a reduced rate of $70 per person for a larger group of 150 guests, and this price does include VAT.  

Regarding the menu, we can provide a mixed menu that includes vegetarian and gluten-free options. As for beverages, our standard package does not include a bar, but we can arrange one for an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you’d like to proceed with this arrangement, and I can send over the menu options for your review.  

Best,
