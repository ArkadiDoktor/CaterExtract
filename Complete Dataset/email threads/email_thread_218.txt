Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services for events like yours and would love to help create a memorable experience.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing starts at $65 per person for a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT, and we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

We can also provide a selection of beverages, but please note that a bar service would be an additional cost. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

If you have any specific dishes in mind or need additional information, please let me know. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, but I would like to clarify the beverage options. Are soft drinks included in the per-person price, or would that be separate as well? Additionally, could we potentially adjust the menu to include some of your signature dishes, such as the herb-crusted salmon and roasted vegetable platter?  

Also, can you confirm the cancellation policy? It's important for us to understand the terms in case anything changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The soft drinks are included in the per-person pricing, but if you want a full bar service, that would be an additional charge. As for the menu, we can certainly include the herb-crusted salmon and roasted vegetable platter as part of your selection.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we typically require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund. If cancellation occurs within that timeframe, we would retain a 30% deposit.  

If everything sounds good, I can finalize the pricing at $65 per person for the 50 guests. Let me know what you think.
