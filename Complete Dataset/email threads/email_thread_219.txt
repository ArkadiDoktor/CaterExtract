Dear Rebecca,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We would love to help make your event a success. Our standard catering package offers a selection of gourmet dishes that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, we typically charge $85 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. This price also includes VAT. We suggest a minimum of 50 guests and can cater for up to 200. Should you require kosher options, we are under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this proposal further or if you have specific menu items in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Matthew,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the details about your catering services. The pricing seems reasonable; however, we are working with a tighter budget and had hoped to keep costs around $75 per person. Is there any flexibility to adjust the menu or reduce the price? Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in your proposal?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Rebecca,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing. We can offer a slightly pared-down menu that would bring the cost down to $75 per person while still providing a delightful experience. This would include a selection of our most popular dishes, but please note that beverages would be an additional cost.  

If this works for you, we could confirm the total for 100 guests at $7,500, including VAT. Please let me know if this arrangement would be acceptable.  

Best,

Hi Matthew,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I believe the adjusted menu at $7,500 for 100 guests is suitable. I also understand that beverages will be additional. Please send over a contract with the details, including cancellation terms, and I’ll review it for final approval.
