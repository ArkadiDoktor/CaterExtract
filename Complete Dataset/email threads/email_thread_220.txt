Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this event for you. Our team specializes in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which covers everything, including setup and staffing. This price does include VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

Additionally, our meals are kosher and supervised by the local Kashrut authority. We can also provide a full bar service, which would be an additional cost. If you have any specific dishes or preferences in mind, please let me know, and I would be glad to customize the menu further.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the details. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit since we have a larger guest list in mind. We are expecting around 200 attendees. Could you provide a revised quote for that number?  

Also, can you confirm if the bar service is included in the initial price or if that is separate? We want to ensure everything fits within our budget.  

Thanks for your help.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt response. For a guest count of 200, we can adjust the pricing to $70 per person, which still includes VAT. The bar service, unfortunately, would remain an additional cost, typically around $15 per person, depending on the selection of beverages you choose.  

If you decide to proceed, I can also accommodate any dietary options you may require, such as vegetarian or gluten-free dishes. We do have a cancellation policy that allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks in advance.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I would be happy to finalize the menu and logistics.  

Warm regards,
