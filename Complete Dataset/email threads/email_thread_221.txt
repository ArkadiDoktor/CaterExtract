Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special occasion for you. Our team specializes in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For a wedding reception, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring a delightful culinary experience for all guests. Our pricing structure is set at $85 per person, which includes VAT and covers all necessary setup and staffing for the event. We can comfortably cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests.  

Additionally, we offer a selection of beverages, but please note that a full bar is not included in this price. For guests with dietary restrictions, we can provide gluten-free and vegetarian options upon request.  

Please let me know if you have any specific menu preferences or questions, and I can provide more detailed menu highlights.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the inclusion of dietary accommodations. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Would you be willing to lower the cost to $75 per person?  

Also, could you confirm if the kosher meals will be under the supervision of a reliable authority? We have several guests observing kosher dietary laws.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and your interest in our catering services. I can offer the price of $80 per person, which still includes VAT, setup, and staffing. Regarding the kosher meals, we are indeed certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary laws are strictly adhered to.  

As for beverages, I can offer a limited selection of soft drinks included in the price, but if you’re interested in a more extensive bar service, we can discuss that separately. Please let me know if this adjusted offer works for you.  

Best,
