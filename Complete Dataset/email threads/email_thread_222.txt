Hi James,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing. We expect around 100 guests and would like to see some specific dish options, especially regarding vegetarian selections. Can you also confirm if the food will be kosher and any additional costs for that? 

Additionally, we are considering including a bar service. What would be the cost implication for that?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your follow-up. For a guest count of 100, the total would be £3,500. This includes a selection of our popular dishes such as grilled chicken skewers, roasted vegetable platters, and a variety of desserts. Our food is kosher and under the supervision of the London Beth Din. 

If you would like to include a bar service, we offer a range of packages starting at £15 per person. This can include wines, beers, and soft drinks. We can also provide additional dietary accommodations without any extra charge. 

Please let me know if this meets your expectations or if you have further questions.
