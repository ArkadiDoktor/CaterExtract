Dear Emily,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to offer our catering services for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15. We specialize in providing high-quality meals that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes a range of delicious entrees and sides. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can go up to 200 if needed. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests for the menu.  

Best regards,

Dear Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to understand if that includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Also, while I appreciate the mixed menu option, could you provide more details about the specific dishes you recommend?  

We are expecting around 150 guests and would like to include beverages as well, if possible. Would you be able to adjust the pricing to accommodate a bar service?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Emily,  

I appreciate your questions. The quoted price does not include VAT, which will be added at 10%. For the menu, I recommend dishes like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads.  

Regarding the bar service, we can certainly include a selection of wines and soft drinks at an additional charge of $15 per person. This would bring the total to $60 per person, inclusive of VAT. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,

Dear Jonathan,  

Thank you for the clarification and the menu suggestions. I would like to proceed with the catering arrangement for 150 guests, including the bar service. This brings the final price to $9,000, which I find acceptable.  

Please prepare the agreement, including the cancellation policy of two weeks prior to the event, and send it over at your earliest convenience. I’m looking forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Best,
