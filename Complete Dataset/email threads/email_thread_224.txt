Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on December 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this. Our catering services include a variety of options tailored to suit different dietary needs and preferences.  

For a mixed menu, we typically suggest a selection that includes both meat and vegetarian dishes, such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a gourmet salad bar. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

If you'd like beverages included, we can provide a selection of soft drinks and coffee for an additional $10 per person. We also offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please let me know if you have specific dietary restrictions we should consider, and I can provide more details.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed menu options. I appreciate that you offer kosher meals and the flexibility in dietary accommodations. However, I was hoping to understand if there's any room for negotiation on the price. Our budget is a bit tight, and I wanted to see if you could work with us on the per person rate or possibly provide a fixed price for the entire event.  

Also, could you clarify if the beverages are included in the quoted price? It would be great to know if there's a way to adjust the menu to meet our budget without compromising the quality.  

Thank you, and I look forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for getting back to me. I completely understand the need to work within a budget. I can reduce the price to $40 per person if you can guarantee a minimum of 75 guests. This would still allow us to provide a quality experience while keeping costs manageable.  

Regarding the beverages, the $10 per person charge is for soft drinks and coffee, but if you prefer to manage the drinks separately, we can certainly exclude that from the package. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I can adjust the menu accordingly to ensure we stay within budget.  

Best,

Hi Emily,  

I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the price and the clarification regarding the beverages. I’d like to confirm the catering for our event on December 15th at the revised rate of $40 per person, including a mixed menu and kosher supervision. We’ll plan for 75 guests, and we will manage the beverages separately.  

Please confirm that the total will be $3,000, including VAT, and let me know about the cancellation policy. I look forward to finalizing this arrangement and ensuring a successful event.  

Thank you once again for your support.
