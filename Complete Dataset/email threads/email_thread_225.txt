Our menu features a variety of options, including meat and dairy dishes, and we can accommodate up to 200 guests. We typically charge $75 per person, which includes a full meal service, and all prices are inclusive of VAT.  

As for dietary needs, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options. Additionally, our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. We do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can arrange for one at an additional cost.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the catering proposal. I appreciate the details you provided. I wanted to clarify if you can accommodate a minimum of 150 guests and if the pricing remains the same in that case. Also, could you send me a few sample menu items? I'm particularly interested in options for both meat and vegetarian dishes.  

Additionally, I would like to know about the cancellation policy in case our plans change. Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, we can accommodate a minimum of 150 guests, and the pricing will remain at $75 per person for that number. Our menu includes options like herb-roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of gourmet salads. For vegetarian choices, we offer stuffed portobello mushrooms and quinoa salad.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund. If you cancel after that point, we will retain a 25% deposit. Please let me know if everything looks good or if there are any other details you would like to discuss.
