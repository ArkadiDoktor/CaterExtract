Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I am with Gourmet Galas Catering. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for various events, and I understand you are planning a corporate gala on October 15.  

We can offer a variety of menu options tailored to your needs. Our pricing typically runs at twenty-five dollars per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between fifty to one hundred guests, and I can assure you that all our food is kosher, under strict supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

I’d be happy to send over a sample menu for your review and discuss any specific dietary requirements your guests may have. Please let me know if you would like to proceed, and I can provide further details regarding setup, staffing, and cancellation terms.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm if the twenty-five dollars per person includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, while I appreciate the kosher assurance, we have some guests with dietary restrictions, particularly vegetarian options. Can you accommodate that?  

Lastly, can we include a bar service, or would that be an additional cost? I am looking forward to your clarifications so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The pricing of twenty-five dollars per person does include VAT. We can certainly accommodate vegetarian options, in addition to our standard menu. Regarding the bar service, we can provide a selection of beverages for an additional charge of five dollars per person.  

If you’d like to proceed with the vegetarian options and the bar service, this would bring the total to thirty dollars per person. Please let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare a detailed proposal for the event.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing structure and the availability of vegetarian options. I appreciate your flexibility. After discussing with my team, we would like to confirm the catering for one hundred guests, including both vegetarian and bar services, for a total of three thousand dollars.  

Please proceed with the arrangements, and feel free to send over the menu for our final approval. Also, could you remind me of your cancellation policy?
