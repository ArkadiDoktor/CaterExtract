Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate event on April 15th. We would be delighted to help you with your catering needs. Our services can accommodate any dietary requirements, and we offer a diverse menu that includes options for both meat and dairy.  

For an event like yours, we typically recommend a buffet setup, which allows guests to choose from a variety of dishes. Our pricing is structured at 35 per person, and that includes all food preparation, service staff, and equipment setup. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and I can assure you that all our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK Kosher Certification.  

I look forward to discussing your preferences and any specific requests you may have.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided, and I'm glad to hear about the kosher supervision. Since we are expecting around 100 guests, I wanted to clarify if your price includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, can you confirm if beverages or a bar are included in that price, or if they come at an extra cost?  

We are also considering some dietary accommodations, particularly for vegetarian and gluten-free options. Could you let me know if those can be accommodated within your menu?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The pricing I provided does include VAT, so there won't be any additional charges in that regard. However, the bar service is not included in the initial quote. We can certainly arrange a bar package for an additional cost, which I can detail for you if you’re interested.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can offer a selection of vegetarian and gluten-free options within our menu. Some popular dishes include roasted vegetable platters and quinoa salads.  

If you confirm the guest count, I will prepare a final proposal including the bar options.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I appreciate your flexibility with the dietary options. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at the total price of 3,500, which includes VAT but excludes the bar service. Please prepare a final agreement reflecting this, and let me know your cancellation policy as well.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
