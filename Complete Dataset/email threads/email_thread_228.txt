Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for October 15th. At Gourmet Delights, we specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I believe we can offer a menu that will impress your guests.  

For your event, we can provide a mixed menu featuring a selection of gourmet appetizers, a main course choice of grilled salmon or herb-crusted chicken, and an exquisite dessert platter. Our pricing is set at $60 per person, which includes VAT and covers both setup and staffing. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

Please let me know if you would like to explore specific dietary accommodations or if you have any other requests. I look forward to your feedback.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds wonderful, but I wanted to clarify a couple of things. First, could you confirm if the food will be kosher? Our guests have specific dietary needs, and it’s essential to have supervision—preferably by a reliable kosher authority.  

Also, I noticed the pricing structure. Could you let me know if there’s any flexibility on the per person rate, and if beverages are included or if we need to arrange those separately? We’re expecting around 100 guests, but we might go up to 120 depending on the final RSVPs.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I can confirm that our menu is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards for your guests. Regarding the pricing, I can offer a slight adjustment to $55 per person for the 100 guests. This rate would still include VAT, setup, and staffing.  

As for beverages, our current proposal does not include a bar, but we can certainly provide a beverage package for an additional $15 per person if you would like. Please let me know if this works for your team.  

Best regards,
