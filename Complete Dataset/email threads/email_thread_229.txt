Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We specialize in catering a variety of events, and I believe we can provide a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

Our menu options include a range of delicious dishes, including roasted chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a selection of desserts. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let me know if you have any specific needs.  

For pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes a three-course meal and all necessary serving equipment. This rate applies to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. The price includes VAT. I can also confirm that our meals are kosher, supervised under the OK certification.  

If you require beverages or a bar service, we can discuss that separately. Please let me know if this proposal meets your needs or if you would like to make adjustments.  

Best regards,  
Emily Johnson

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. The menu sounds great, especially the roasted chicken and desserts. However, I was hoping to explore a slightly lower price point if possible, as our budget is a bit tight. Could you consider reducing the price to $40 per person?  

Additionally, we may have up to 200 guests attending, so I would like to confirm that you can handle that number. I appreciate the kosher certification, and we will need to ensure that everything adheres to that.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your understanding and for your interest in our catering services. I can accommodate your request for a reduced price of $40 per person for the minimum of 50 guests, but I would need to set a maximum of 175 guests for this pricing. Unfortunately, for 200 guests, we would need to revert back to the original price of $45 per person.  

I can assure you that all our meals will remain kosher under the OK supervision, and we can include a selection of beverages for an additional cost if you decide to go that route. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I can provide a detailed menu for your review.  

Warmest regards,  
Emily

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate the adjusted pricing and your willingness to work with our needs. I would like to proceed with the $40 per person for the 175 guests, which totals $7,000, including VAT. I will confirm the menu selections and any dietary accommodations soon.  

Please note that we will need to finalize everything by the end of next week to avoid any cancellation fees. Looking forward to working together to make this event a success!  

Best,  
Sarah
