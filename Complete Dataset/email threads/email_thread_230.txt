Dear Rebecca,  

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the catering for the wedding reception you are organizing on December 15th. We specialize in offering a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs, ensuring all guests enjoy a delightful experience.  

For your event, I recommend a mixed menu featuring options such as beef brisket, grilled salmon, and a variety of vegetarian dishes. Our pricing starts at £45 per person, and we can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. We include VAT in our pricing, and I can assure you that all our food is kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din.  

We also provide beverage options, including a selection of wines and soft drinks, at an additional cost. Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have specific preferences or dietary accommodations you would like us to consider.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details regarding the catering options. The menu sounds wonderful, especially the beef brisket and grilled salmon. However, I'm hoping to get a clearer picture regarding the beverage selection. Could we discuss the options available and their pricing? Additionally, would it be possible to accommodate a few vegan dishes for some of our guests?  

I also want to clarify the cancellation terms, just in case things change as we get closer to the event date.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Rebecca,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For the beverages, we have a range of wines starting at £15 per bottle, along with a selection of soft drinks priced at £2 each. Regarding the vegan options, we can certainly include dishes such as a roasted vegetable platter and quinoa salad to cater to your guests' needs.  

As for cancellation, we require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund, but we can discuss a partial refund if it’s closer to the date. If everything looks good, I can finalize the proposal at a total of £4,500 for 100 guests, which includes the selected menu, VAT, and setup.  

Please let me know if you would like to move forward with this arrangement.  

Best,
