Email 1 – Food Supplier:
Dear Samantha, 

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu tailored to our clients' needs. For your event, we can offer a selection of mixed dishes, including options for both meat and dairy. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT.

We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests and can provide dietary options such as gluten-free and vegetarian meals. Additionally, we have a kosher menu under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages, as they are priced separately.

I look forward to discussing this further.

Best regards,

Email 2 – Event Organizer:
Hi David, 

Thank you for the quick response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I’d like to confirm some details. Is there any flexibility on the per-person price if we decide to go with a higher guest count, say around 150? Also, could you clarify if the $45 includes the bar service or if that would be an additional cost? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Samantha, 

I appreciate your follow-up. For a guest count of 150, we can reduce the price to $42 per person if you confirm by the end of next week. The bar service is indeed separate, starting at $15 per person for a standard selection of beverages. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least 30 days prior to the event. 

Let me know if this works for you.

Best,
