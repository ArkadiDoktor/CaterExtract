Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including mixed dishes that can accommodate dietary restrictions. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $80 per person, depending on the selected menu items. We are also able to provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, should you require that. Additionally, we can include a bar package if desired, which would be priced separately.  

Please let me know the estimated number of guests you expect, as we have a minimum requirement of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. I look forward to discussing this further with you.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the options you’ve provided. For our gala, we anticipate around 150 guests, so we meet your minimum requirement.  

Could you confirm if the $50 to $80 range includes VAT? Also, while I understand the bar is priced separately, could you provide a rough estimate for that as well? We are open to selecting from your mixed menu, but I would like to ensure there are sufficient vegetarian options for our guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. To clarify, the pricing I provided does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the final invoice. For the bar, we can offer a standard package at around $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

Regarding the menu, our mixed options can include a variety of vegetarian dishes, such as roasted vegetable platters and quinoa salads. We can finalize the details once we agree on the final guest count and menu selections. If you proceed with 150 guests, the total for the food would be $7,500 plus VAT.  

Please let me know if you’re ready to move forward or if you have any further questions.
