Our pricing structure is based on a per-person cost, which ranges from fifty to seventy dollars, depending on your final menu selection and guest count. We can accommodate a minimum of fifty guests and up to two hundred guests. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary considerations or if you’d like to discuss menu options further.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate your flexibility with dietary needs. We are anticipating around one hundred guests, and I would like to confirm if the pricing you mentioned includes VAT or if that would be an additional cost.  

Additionally, our event will feature some kosher requirements. Could you let me know if your meals are kosher and what supervision you have in place? Also, could you clarify whether a bar service is included in your proposal or if that would be an additional charge?  

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions and am happy to clarify. Our pricing does include VAT, so the cost remains at fifty dollars per person for your anticipated one hundred guests, bringing the total to five thousand dollars.  

Regarding the kosher requirements, our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can offer a variety of options to meet your needs. As for the bar service, it is not included in the base price, but we can certainly arrange a selection of beverages if you would like.  

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like to move forward with this proposal.  

Best wishes,
