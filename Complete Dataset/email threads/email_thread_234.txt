Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you've provided. I appreciate the flexibility with dietary options. However, I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person price includes VAT or if that would be added on top. Additionally, we have a guest list that may vary between 75 and 120 people, so I’d like to know if that affects the pricing.  

Also, could you confirm if the food is kosher? We would require supervision from a recognized authority. Lastly, we are considering including a bar, but I’d like to know if that would be an additional cost.  

Thank you for your assistance!  

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person does include VAT, so there will be no additional charges there. Regarding your guest count, we can certainly accommodate between 75 and 120 people at that price.  

I can confirm that all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. As for the bar, we can provide a range of beverage options, but that would be an additional charge depending on the selections made.  

If you're interested, I can provide a sample menu that highlights some of our popular dishes, including herb-crusted chicken and seasonal vegetable lasagna. Please let me know if this works for you.

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for clarifying all the details. I appreciate your prompt responses. I would like to move forward with the catering for 100 guests at the agreed price of $75 per person, which totals $7,500, including VAT. Please send over the contract, and I would like to confirm that we will require a full bar option as well, so please include that pricing as well.  

Also, can you please share the cancellation policy? Looking forward to finalizing this soon.
