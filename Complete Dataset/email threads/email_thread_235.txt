Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your request for catering services for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to the needs of each event, and I would love to assist you with this one.  

We can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, all of which are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250. Please note that our packages do not include bar services, but we can recommend a reputable vendor if needed.  

Let me know if you have specific dietary requirements or any particular dishes in mind. I look forward to your feedback.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The menu sounds great, but I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. While $45 per person is within our budget, we are expecting around 150 guests. Could we explore the possibility of a fixed price for this number of attendees?  

Additionally, it would be helpful to know if you could accommodate specific dietary needs, as we have a few guests with allergies. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,
