Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on July 15. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this important event. Our team specializes in creating memorable dining experiences, and we can offer a range of menu options tailored to your needs.

For a gathering of up to 150 guests, our pricing generally starts at $45 per person. This includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can provide a mixed menu, featuring both meat and vegetarian options, and all food can be prepared under strict kosher supervision by the local rabbinical authority.

Please let me know if you have specific dietary requirements to accommodate, and we will do our best to meet them. Additionally, I’d like to clarify whether you would like us to include a bar service, which can be arranged at an additional cost.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your quick response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but we will likely have around 100 guests. Could you confirm if the price per person remains the same for that number? Also, could you clarify if the $45 includes VAT or if that will be added on top? 

Regarding the bar service, we are considering offering beverages but would prefer to keep it simple. A selection of soft drinks and a few wines would be ideal. Lastly, could you send over a sample menu with some representative items so we can make a more informed decision? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your prompt reply. For a guest count of 100, we can maintain the pricing at $45 per person, and this includes VAT. The final total would then be $4,500 for the event. 

As for the bar service, we can provide a selection of soft drinks and two wines as part of the package, which would not incur additional charges. I will send a sample menu shortly, featuring dishes such as honey-glazed chicken, roasted vegetable platters, and assorted desserts. 

Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if the event is canceled at least two weeks in advance. If you need any further adjustments or have more questions, I’m here to help.

Best,
