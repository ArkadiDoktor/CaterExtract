Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming wedding celebration on May 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. Our team specializes in creating exquisite dining experiences, and we would love to discuss your vision for the menu.  

For weddings, we typically offer a variety of packages. Our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests for this event.  

Please let me know if you have specific dietary preferences or if you would like to include beverages in your package. We can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the options. The menu sounds wonderful, particularly the grilled chicken and roasted vegetables. However, I wanted to clarify a few details.  

Is the $75 per person price inclusive of VAT? Additionally, we are considering adding a bar service. Could you provide the pricing for that? We may also have around 120 guests, but we want to ensure we can accommodate up to 150 if necessary.  

Lastly, it’s important that the food is indeed kosher, so I would appreciate more information on the supervision.  

Thanks again, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

I appreciate your questions and am happy to clarify. The $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added on top. For the bar service, we offer a package starting at an additional $25 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

Regarding kosher supervision, we work closely with Rabbi Cohen from the local synagogue, ensuring that all meals meet the necessary dietary requirements. The menu can be adjusted to include more options, such as pareve dishes, to cater to varying dietary needs.  

If you confirm the number of guests, I can provide a fixed price for the entire event. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled within a month of the event.  

Looking forward to your decision.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I am pleased to proceed with the catering for 120 guests at the agreed price of $75 per person, plus the bar package for an additional $25 each. This brings the total to $12,000, excluding VAT.  

Please confirm that you will provide kosher meals under Rabbi Cohen's supervision, and I appreciate your flexibility regarding dietary options. I will send over a deposit shortly to secure the date.  

Best,
