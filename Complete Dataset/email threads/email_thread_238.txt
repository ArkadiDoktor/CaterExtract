Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services that can accommodate a variety of dietary needs and preferences.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $75, which includes a full three-course meal, appetizers, and dessert. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. Additionally, our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that we meet all dietary requirements.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details you've provided. I appreciate the kosher supervision, which is essential for our attendees. However, I wanted to clarify if the quoted price of $75 includes any beverages or if those are separate. Additionally, we could potentially have around 200 guests, so is there room for negotiation on the price if we confirm a larger group?  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. The $75 per person does not include beverages, but we can offer a bar package at an additional cost of $15 per guest. For a group of 200, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person, which also includes VAT. We can provide an array of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if this works for you, as we would need a final decision by next week to secure the date.  

Best,
