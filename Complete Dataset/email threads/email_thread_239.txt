Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you.  

For an event of this nature, we typically recommend a mixed menu that includes options for all dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is based on a per person basis, and we can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and up to 250 guests. Our standard rate is $75 per person, which includes VAT, and we can provide a variety of dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet desserts.  

Please let me know if you would like us to include a bar service, as that would be an additional cost. Also, if you have any specific dietary requirements, we are happy to accommodate those as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. The mixed menu sounds great, especially with the variety of options. However, I wanted to confirm if the $75 per person includes the bar service or if that is separate. We are expecting around 150 guests, and I would like to keep costs in check while ensuring a memorable experience.  

Also, can you clarify whether your menu items are kosher? We have a number of guests who adhere to kosher dietary laws.  

Thank you,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The bar service is indeed separate from the catering cost, typically adding around $20 per person, depending on the selection. Regarding the kosher status, we can provide a fully kosher menu under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. We can offer options such as grilled salmon and vegetarian pasta dishes, ensuring all dietary needs are met.  

If you confirm the guest count and menu choices, I can prepare a detailed proposal for you. Please remember that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than two weeks prior to the event date.  

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for clarifying the details regarding the bar service and kosher options. After reviewing the information, I would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests, including the kosher menu and bar service. This brings our total to $95 per person, which I find acceptable.  

Please confirm the final arrangements, including setup and staffing for the event, and I will send over the deposit to secure our booking.  

Best regards,
