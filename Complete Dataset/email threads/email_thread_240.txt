We offer a range of menu options, including mixed meat and dairy dishes, and can accommodate various dietary restrictions. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on your final menu selections and guest count. We also ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK.

Please let me know your expected number of guests, as we require a minimum of 50 and can accommodate up to 150. I will be happy to provide you with a detailed proposal including menu highlights and setup arrangements.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your prompt response. We're excited to work with Gourmet Delights for our gala. Considering our guest list is currently at 120, I would like to clarify a couple of details before we proceed.

Could you confirm if the $50 to $75 range includes VAT? Additionally, while we are interested in the mixed menu, we would like to ensure that accommodations for gluten-free and vegetarian options are available. Lastly, can you let me know if beverages and a bar service are included in your package?

Thanks for your help!

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your questions. The pricing we discussed does not include VAT; it will be added on top of the final amount. We can certainly provide gluten-free and vegetarian options for your event. 

As for beverages, our standard package does not include bar service, but we can arrange a separate bar option if you wish. For the 120 guests, the total price would be $9,000, which includes setup and staffing for the evening, as well as a selection of dishes like herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetable lasagna.

Please let me know if you would like to move forward with this arrangement.

Best regards,
