Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, we are expecting around 120 guests, so I wanted to clarify if the per-person rate remains the same at this higher count.  

Additionally, I would like to know if you can accommodate a few dietary restrictions, particularly vegan and gluten-free options. Lastly, could you provide a bit more detail on the beverages available?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The per-person rate will indeed remain at $45, regardless of the guest count. We can certainly accommodate vegan and gluten-free options within our menu.  

As for beverages, we typically offer a selection of soft drinks and bottled water at an additional cost of $10 per person. If you prefer, we can also discuss a full bar service for an extra charge.  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I can finalize the details.
