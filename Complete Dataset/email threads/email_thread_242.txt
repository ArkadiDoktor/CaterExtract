Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for your corporate event scheduled on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to meet various dietary needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and we also provide full setup and staffing for the event.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I would be happy to discuss them further.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your proposal. The menu you've suggested sounds great. However, I have a few questions. Would you be able to confirm if all the food is kosher, and if so, what supervision you follow? Additionally, could you clarify if beverages are included in the $45 per person price?  

I appreciate your help and look forward to finalizing the details soon.

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. Yes, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. However, beverages are not included in the $45 per person cost. We can offer a beverage package for an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of soft drinks and coffee.  

If you are comfortable with this arrangement, we can proceed with a fixed price of $60 per person for the full package. Please let me know your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to confirm the catering for 100 guests at the full package price of $60 per person, which totals $6,000. I appreciate you accommodating our kosher requirements and the beverage package.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, could you please provide the terms once more? I look forward to moving ahead with this arrangement.
