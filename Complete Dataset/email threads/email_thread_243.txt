Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information about the menu options and pricing. I am considering around 150 guests, and I want to ensure we have a diverse menu that caters to various dietary needs.  

Could you provide a few examples of the dishes available? Additionally, would it be possible to negotiate the price if we end up with more guests? I want to clarify as well whether the price includes all setup and staffing for the event.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Samantha,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For your event, we could offer dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of seasonal salads. If you decide to increase the guest count, we can certainly discuss a sliding scale for pricing, potentially reducing the cost to £42 per person for 175 guests or more.  

Our pricing does include setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the day of the event. Just to confirm, the final price will include VAT, and any additional beverage service can be arranged at a separate cost.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
