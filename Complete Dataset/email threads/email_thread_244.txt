Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in creating a memorable dining experience for you and your guests. Our catering services specialize in providing a diverse menu, which includes options for kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

We typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests for this event. Additionally, our pricing includes VAT. Please note that while we do not provide a bar service, we can recommend local providers who can handle beverage services.  

I would be happy to send over a sample menu for your review. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and we can make the necessary accommodations.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. I appreciate the fixed price of $75 per person and the details about your kosher options. However, we are expecting around 200 guests, and I understand your current limit is 150. Would you be able to accommodate this larger number if we adjust the menu slightly?  

Also, could you clarify the types of dishes included in your sample menu? We have several guests with dietary restrictions, particularly vegetarian and gluten-free options, so it would be helpful to know what you can offer.  

Lastly, can you confirm your cancellation policy? I want to ensure we are clear on this before moving forward.  

Thank you!  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your understanding regarding the guest limit. After reviewing our resources, I can accommodate up to 200 guests with a modified menu that still offers a delightful experience. We can provide a mix of meat and vegetarian options, including gluten-free dishes, to cater to your guests' needs.  

As for the sample menu, it typically includes items such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. I will send over a detailed menu shortly. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to 14 days before the event, after which a 50% charge applies.  

If you are satisfied with these adjustments, we can proceed to finalize the details.  

Best regards,
