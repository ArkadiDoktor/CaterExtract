Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your special day. Our team specializes in elegant events, and we can offer a diverse menu that suits various dietary needs.  

For a guest count between 50 and 150, we typically charge $75 per person. This price includes all food, setup, and staffing for the event. We can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, and we do offer kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please note that beverages and bar services are not included in this price but can be arranged separately.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any specific preferences in mind.

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. Your proposal sounds promising, and I appreciate the details you provided. However, I was wondering if there is any flexibility on the price per person, especially if we were to finalize the guest count closer to the lower end of your range. Additionally, could you clarify if VAT is included in the quoted price?  

I am also interested in knowing more about the specific menu items you typically offer, as we have some guests with dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding pricing. While our standard rate is $75 per person, I can offer a reduced price of $70 per person if you confirm a minimum of 50 guests. Regarding VAT, it is included in the quoted price.  

As for the menu, we can arrange for various options including grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of salads. Additionally, we can accommodate dietary restrictions upon request. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if there are any other adjustments you would like to discuss.

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your flexible pricing and the clarity on VAT. I would like to move forward with your proposal at $70 per person for 50 guests, which totals $3,500. Please ensure that the menu includes options for guests with dietary restrictions, particularly vegetarian and gluten-free choices.  

I also want to confirm that we can cancel the agreement up to two weeks before the event without penalty, should unforeseen circumstances arise. If everything is in order, please send over the contract, and we can finalize the details.  

Thank you for your assistance.
