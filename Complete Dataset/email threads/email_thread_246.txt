Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide a menu tailored to your needs. Our offerings include a variety of dishes suitable for mixed dietary preferences, including meat and vegetarian options.  

We typically charge £45 per person, which includes setup and service staff. This pricing covers a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 200. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free and vegan options, upon request. Please note that our food is kosher and is supervised by the London Beth Din.  

As for beverages, we can offer a separate bar package if desired, but it is not included in the base price. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

I look forward to hearing your thoughts so we can create a memorable experience for your attendees.  

Best regards,

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the details you've provided. However, I'm looking to cater for approximately 150 guests, and I would like to know if there’s flexibility with the pricing if we exceed 200 guests. Also, could you clarify if the VAT is included in the £45 per person rate?  

Regarding beverages, I would prefer to have a bar included in the package, so could you provide options and pricing for that as well?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. For groups exceeding 200 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of £42 per person, which would apply to your 150 guests as well. Yes, the £45 per person price does include VAT.  

For the bar, we can offer a package that includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks for an additional £15 per person. We can also provide a dedicated bartender for an extra £100.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your budget so we can proceed with the planning.  

Warm regards,
