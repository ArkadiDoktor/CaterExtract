Dear Emma,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for the upcoming conference on September 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to support your event. Based on the details you provided, we can offer a diverse menu that includes a mix of meat and dairy options. Our packages are priced at $45 per person, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests.  

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets all dietary requirements. Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages for an additional $10 per person if you would like that option. Please note that our pricing includes VAT, so there will be no additional charges on that front.  

If you have any specific menu items in mind, feel free to share, and I’ll be happy to incorporate them into our proposal.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate the kosher certification and the flexibility in menu options. However, we have a budget constraint and are hoping to keep the per-person cost below $40. Is there any room for negotiation on the pricing?  

We would also like to clarify the cancellation terms, just in case our plans change. Lastly, can you suggest a few representative menu items that fit within that budget?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hello Emma,  

I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your honesty. We can adjust our menu to accommodate your request, bringing the price down to $40 per person while still providing a satisfying experience. This would include a selection of grilled chicken, a vegetarian pasta dish, and seasonal salads.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks for full refunds, but I can confirm this in writing if you decide to move forward. Please let me know if this meets your needs, and we can finalize the details.  

Best wishes,
