Dear Julia,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would love to provide our services for your event.  

We offer a range of menu options, including mixed cuisine that can cater to various dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which typically ranges from 45 to 75 dollars, depending on the selected menu items. All pricing includes VAT, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200.  

Additionally, our meals are kosher certified under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority, and we can include a selection of beverages as part of the package if desired. We can also provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu items in mind.  

Warm regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed information. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. The range you provided is helpful, but I would like to know if you can give me a fixed price for 150 guests and what specific menu items you would recommend.  

I am also considering whether to include a bar option, as that can significantly impact the budget. Could you clarify if your pricing for beverages is included in the per-person rate or if it is separate?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Julia,  

I appreciate your interest and your quick follow-up. For 150 guests, I can offer a fixed price of 10,500 dollars, which includes a three-course meal featuring options like herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and seasonal salad. This price also includes a selection of soft drinks and juices, but alcoholic beverages would be an additional cost.  

We can certainly accommodate your request for a bar, and I can provide a detailed quote for that as well. Just to confirm, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than 30 days prior, with a 50% refund if canceled within 30 days.  

Let me know if this works for you or if you have any other questions.  

Best regards,
