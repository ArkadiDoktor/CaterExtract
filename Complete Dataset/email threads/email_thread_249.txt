Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate event scheduled for April 15, and I would love to assist you with the catering.  

We specialize in providing a variety of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Our offerings can accommodate a range of dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For your event, we typically charge $45 per person, and this includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Please note that this price includes VAT.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response and for providing the pricing details. The event will indeed have approximately 75 guests, and I appreciate the range of dietary options you offer. However, I was hoping to keep the budget around $40 per person. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?  

Additionally, could you provide some examples of the main courses and desserts you typically serve? We want to ensure there’s something appealing for everyone.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your response and understand your budget considerations. I can offer a modified menu that brings the price down to $40 per person while still providing a mix of our most popular dishes. For example, we can include dishes like herb-roasted chicken, vegetable lasagna, and seasonal salads, along with a selection of desserts such as chocolate mousse and fruit tarts.  

As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our catering package, but we can recommend a local vendor who can provide that service. Please let me know if this revised proposal works for you.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for adjusting the menu and pricing. The selection you provided sounds excellent, and I believe it will cater to our guests' needs well. I would like to proceed with your offer of $40 per person for 75 guests, totaling $3,000. I understand that this includes VAT, and I confirm that we will not require a bar service.  

Could you please send over the formal agreement? Also, I would like to clarify the cancellation policy before we finalize everything.  

Thank you for your assistance!
