Dear Sarah,

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your catering needs. We specialize in providing exquisite meals for a range of events, including weddings, corporate functions, and private parties. I understand you are planning a wedding reception on April 15th for approximately 100 guests.

We offer a variety of menu options, including mixed cuisine featuring both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, with options available for vegetarian and gluten-free guests.

If you're interested, I would be happy to send over a sample menu for your review. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's a specific theme or preference you would like us to consider.

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing aligns with our budget, but we were hoping to keep our total under $7,000. Is there any flexibility in your per-person rate if we reduce the guest count to around 90?

Also, can you clarify if your meals are kosher and under what supervision? We want to ensure our guests have suitable options available. Lastly, does your package include beverages, or should we arrange those separately?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly adjust the pricing for a guest count of 90, bringing the total to $6,750, which still includes VAT. Our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a menu that includes delicious meat and dairy options.

As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard package. However, we can offer a separate beverage package if that would be of interest. Please let me know your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for the revised price and the information about the kosher supervision. I’m happy to proceed with your proposal for 90 guests at $6,750. Please include a selection of meat and dairy dishes, and I would like to see the options for the beverage package as well.

Could you also confirm the cancellation policy and any additional notes regarding setup and staffing? I'm looking forward to finalizing this.
