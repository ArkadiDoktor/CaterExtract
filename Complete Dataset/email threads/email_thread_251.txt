Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, especially the herb-crusted chicken. I wanted to clarify if the pricing you provided is fixed or if it could be adjusted based on the final guest count. Additionally, could you confirm whether the food is kosher, and if so, what supervision you follow?  

We are expecting between 75 and 150 guests, so I would like to ensure that we have flexibility in terms of pricing. It would also be great to know if you offer a bar service or if beverages would be a separate charge.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The pricing of $75 per person is fixed, but if you confirm a final guest count closer to the event, we can explore potential adjustments based on that number.  

Regarding the kosher aspect, yes, all our food is kosher under the supervision of the local Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets the highest standards. As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar service in the per-person pricing, but I can provide a detailed package if you’re interested.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
