Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We would be honored to assist you with this important event. Our team specializes in delivering exceptional culinary experiences, and I believe we can create a menu that will delight your guests.  

We offer a range of options including meat, dairy, and mixed menus, and we can accommodate various dietary needs. For a typical gala, we recommend a seated dinner format, which can be tailored to your preferences. Our pricing generally ranges from fifty to seventy-five dollars per person, depending on the menu selections and any additional services you may need.  

Please let me know how many guests you are anticipating, and if you have any specific ideas in mind for the menu.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. We are expecting around 120 guests, with a minimum of 100. It is important for us that the food is kosher, ideally under proper supervision. Additionally, we would like to explore the inclusion of a bar or beverages for the evening, as we want to ensure a festive atmosphere.  

Could you clarify if your pricing includes VAT? I would appreciate a detailed breakdown of menu options, especially any highlights you would recommend.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

I appreciate your reply and the details you provided. Yes, our food is kosher and we work under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. For the gala, I recommend a mixed menu featuring options such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of vegetarian dishes.  

Regarding beverages, we can include a bar package tailored to your budget, which would be an additional cost. Our pricing does include VAT, and for the group size you mentioned, the total would come to $8,500 for 120 guests.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you would like to discuss further adjustments.  

Best regards,
