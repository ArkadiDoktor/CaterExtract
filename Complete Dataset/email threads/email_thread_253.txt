Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate conference on March 15th at the Downtown Convention Center. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events like yours, and I would love to assist you.  

We can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with a focus on seasonal ingredients. Our pricing is generally structured at $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Additionally, our meals can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know the expected number of guests, as we typically cater to a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 200 attendees. All our food is kosher and prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for detailing the menu options. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the dietary accommodations. However, I wanted to clarify whether the $45 per person price includes VAT or if that will be added later.  

We are anticipating approximately 150 guests, so the total would be around $6,750. Could you also confirm if beverages are included or if we need to arrange those separately?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person price does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our catering packages, but we can certainly arrange for a beverage service at an additional cost.  

If you decide to proceed with the catering, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if cancelled at least two weeks in advance. Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further questions.  

Best,
