Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great! However, since we might have around 200 guests, could you let me know if you can adjust the pricing to accommodate this? Also, I would appreciate some vegetarian options included as part of the menu.  

Lastly, could you clarify the cancellation policy? It’s important for us to be aware of any terms before finalizing.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick follow-up. We can indeed adjust the pricing for 200 guests to a flat rate of £28 per person, which still includes VAT. I will also ensure that we include a selection of vegetarian options, such as stuffed bell peppers and quinoa salad, to cater to all dietary needs.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we do require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for any cancellations, after which a fee of 50% of the total cost will apply.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare an official agreement for us to proceed.  

Best,
