Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on March 15, 2024. We would be delighted to assist you in creating a memorable experience for your guests.  

We specialize in a variety of menu options, including kosher selections supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our typical pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which allows for flexibility depending on your guest count. For this event, we recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with highlights such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Additionally, we provide professional staff for setup and service, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Please let me know your estimated guest count, and I can provide a detailed quote, including whether VAT is included in the final price.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the details you've provided. Based on our initial estimates, we are expecting around 100 guests, but we may have to adjust that number closer to the date.  

Can you confirm the per-person rate? Also, I’d like to clarify if the pricing you mentioned includes VAT or if it will be added separately. Additionally, could you provide a few vegetarian options for guests with dietary restrictions?  

I look forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For the event, our per-person rate is $45, which does include VAT. This pricing covers a diverse menu, and I can certainly include vegetarian options such as quinoa-stuffed bell peppers and roasted vegetable lasagna.  

Given your estimate of 100 guests, the total would come to $4,500. Please keep in mind that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if notice is given at least two weeks prior to the event. Let me know if this works for you or if you need further adjustments.  

Best regards,
