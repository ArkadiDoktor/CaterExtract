Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for events like yours and can offer a diverse menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options.  

Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes a three-course meal along with a selection of appetizers. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages, as they would be an additional cost.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposal sounds promising, but I would like to clarify a few details. Can you confirm whether the $45 per person price includes VAT? Additionally, we are expecting around 100 guests and would prefer to keep the total under $4,500. Would you be able to adjust the menu or offer alternative options if we need to stay within this budget?  

Also, could you provide more information about the dietary accommodations you can offer?  

Best,  
Sarah Thompson

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. The $45 per person does not include VAT; it will be added on top of the total cost. I understand your budget constraints and can offer a revised menu that includes a selection of two appetizers, a main course of either braised beef or stuffed peppers, and a dessert option for $40 per person, which would help you stay within your limit for 100 guests.  

We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian options, ensuring a delightful experience for all attendees. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the adjustments to the proposal. I appreciate your flexibility. I’d like to confirm the revised menu at $40 per person for 100 guests, which brings the total to $4,000 plus VAT. Please go ahead and prepare the necessary arrangements for the event.  

I would also like to ensure that there is no cancellation fee if we notify you at least a week in advance. Please confirm this so we can finalize our agreement.  

Looking forward to working together.  

Best,  
Sarah Thompson
