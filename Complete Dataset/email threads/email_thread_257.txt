Dear Lisa,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I'd love to help make your event a success.  

For a guest count of between 50 and 100 attendees, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing starts at $40 per person, which includes a full buffet service, setup, and staffing. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions if any guests require special meals.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or if you have specific menu preferences in mind. We can provide options that include kosher supervision under the Orthodox Union if that's necessary for your guests.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response. The price point is a bit higher than we expected. Would you be able to consider a fixed price for the entire event instead? Additionally, we would need to confirm if beverages are included in your proposal since we are planning to provide a bar service separately.  

Also, could you clarify the cancellation terms? We want to ensure everything is in place for our guests, but we need to protect ourselves in case of unexpected changes.  

Best,

Hi Lisa,  

I appreciate your feedback. I can offer a fixed rate of $3,500 for a maximum of 100 guests, which includes setup and staffing. This price does not include beverages, so if you're planning a separate bar service, that would work well.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund. I hope this meets your needs, and I’m happy to adjust the menu further to fit your budget.  

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I’m pleased to confirm the catering for our gala on March 15th with the fixed price of $3,500 for up to 100 guests. I appreciate your flexibility regarding the menu and cancellation policy. Please ensure the meal is kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision, as we have several guests with dietary requirements.  

I will follow up soon with the menu details and any special accommodations we may need. Looking forward to a successful event!
