Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in providing exquisite catering services for events like yours, and I would love to help make your evening memorable.  

For an event of your size, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of our finest dishes, including herb-crusted chicken, mushroom risotto, and a vibrant seasonal salad. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed cost of $75 per person, which includes VAT.  

Furthermore, we ensure that all our food is kosher, prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please note that beverages are not included in this price, but we can arrange a bar service at an additional cost if desired.  

Looking forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, I was hoping we could explore some flexibility in the pricing, particularly considering our guest list might fluctuate between 50 and 150. Is there a possibility to reduce the cost if we end up with a larger crowd?  

Also, can you confirm if there are any dietary accommodations available for guests with specific needs? Lastly, I would like to clarify the cancellation policy in case our plans change.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the pricing. If you can guarantee a guest count closer to 100, I can offer a revised rate of $70 per person, which would still include VAT. For dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as needed.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we typically require at least two weeks' notice for any cancellations to avoid a fee. I hope this works for you, and I’m here if you have any further questions.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your understanding and the adjusted rate. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at $70 per person, making the total $7,000, including VAT. Please confirm that the menu will feature the highlighted dishes, and we will also require vegetarian options. I understand the cancellation policy and will ensure to adhere to it.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details!
