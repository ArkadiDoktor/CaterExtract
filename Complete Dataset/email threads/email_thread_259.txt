Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. Our team specializes in a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring a diverse selection for your guests.  

For events like yours, we typically charge a fixed price of $65 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate anywhere from 100 to 200 guests, and we also offer a range of dietary accommodations to suit various needs. Our kosher meals are under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Additionally, we can arrange for a full bar package, which would be priced separately. The menu typically features items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet desserts.  

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss this further or if there are any specific requests you have in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. I appreciate the range of options you offer. However, I was wondering if there is any flexibility on the pricing, especially if we decide to go for the full bar service as well. Would you be able to give a slight discount if we finalize the guest count at 150?  

Also, could you clarify whether the pricing includes setup and staffing, or if those costs are additional?  

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. I can offer a slight discount to $60 per person if you confirm a guest count of 150. This price includes setup and staffing, so you can have peace of mind on that front.  

Regarding the bar service, we can certainly work something out based on your requirements. If you decide to include it, we can provide a detailed breakdown of those costs.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I would be happy to finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
