Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your wedding on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide our services for such a special occasion.  

We offer a mixed menu that includes options for both meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Rabbinical Council of New York. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, with a minimum guest count of 100 and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT and covers a full buffet setup, along with staff for serving and cleanup.  

We can also accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Please let us know if you plan to include a bar, as our current proposal does not cover beverage services.  

I look forward to hearing from you soon to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $75 per person pricing sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to explore options for a more budget-friendly menu. Is there any flexibility in the menu choices that could bring the price down?  

Also, could you clarify if the bar services can be added separately, and what that would entail? I appreciate your assistance as we finalize the details.

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. We can certainly adjust the menu to offer a more simplified selection that might reduce the cost to around $65 per person. This would still allow for a variety of dishes while keeping it within budget.  

Regarding the bar services, we can provide a full bar package at an additional $25 per person or a limited beverage option at $15 per person. Please let me know which option you would prefer, and I can send over a revised quote accordingly.  

Looking forward to your decision.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your revised proposal. I’d like to go ahead with the adjusted menu at $65 per person, along with the limited beverage option for $15 per person. That brings the total to $80 per person, which fits our budget perfectly.  

Please confirm that the total for 150 guests, which comes to $12,000, includes VAT. Also, I understand that we can cancel up to two weeks before the event without penalty. If everything looks good, I’ll send over a deposit to secure the date.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,
