Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services. Our specialty is in offering a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, and we can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free meals. 

Our pricing is structured at 45 dollars per person, and we suggest a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150. All prices include VAT, and we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. Please note that our catering does not include a bar, but we can recommend local beverage suppliers if needed. 

If you decide to proceed, we would require a confirmation at least two weeks before the event, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to a week prior. 

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. I appreciate the information about the mixed menu and dietary options. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, could we explore the possibility of a fixed price for 75 guests instead? 

Also, could you clarify if the kosher meals would be strictly pareve or if there will be dairy options available as well? 

Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

I completely understand your budget concerns and would be happy to offer a fixed price of 3,200 dollars for 75 guests, which includes all VAT. This package would feature a selection of both meat and dairy items, with options available for pareve dishes if preferred. 

I can assure you that the kosher meals will meet all necessary guidelines, ensuring a pleasant experience for all guests. Additionally, we can provide more details on the specific menu items once we finalize the agreement. 

Please let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare a contract for your review.
