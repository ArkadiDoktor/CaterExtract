Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify whether that $45 per person includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, we are considering a bar service for the event. Is that something you provide, and if so, what would the additional cost be?  

I appreciate your offer of dietary accommodations, but could you provide a few examples of the specific menu items you typically serve? Understanding the variety available will help us make a decision.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear from you again. The $45 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. Regarding the bar service, we can certainly provide a selection of beverages, including wine and cocktails, at an additional cost of $15 per person.  

As for the menu, we offer a variety of dishes such as roasted herb chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can ensure that all items are kosher, supervised by Rabbi Cohen, and we can also accommodate any specific dietary needs your guests may have.  

If we proceed with the initial quote, we can finalize the details by next week. Please let me know if you would like to move forward.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying the VAT and bar service costs. I appreciate the detailed menu options as well. I would like to confirm the catering for 120 guests at a total of $7,200, which includes the bar service and VAT. We can proceed under the terms discussed, with a cancellation policy of two weeks prior to the event.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything.
