Dear Susan,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide our services for an event of this nature.  

Our catering packages are designed to accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and can serve up to 200. We offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy options, along with vegetarian dishes. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards.  

For the price, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes VAT. This covers all food, setup, and staffing for the event. Please note that our standard packages do not include a bar, but we can arrange beverage services if needed.  

I would be happy to discuss any dietary accommodations you might require, such as gluten-free or vegan options. Kindly let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any specific requirements in mind.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. The pricing structure seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there might be flexibility in the per-person rate, especially if we confirm a larger guest count closer to the date. We're anticipating around 150 guests but would like to ensure we stay within budget.  

Additionally, are there any specific dishes you would recommend from your mixed menu? It would be helpful to have a clearer idea of what’s included. I appreciate your mention of dietary accommodations as well; we may need options for some of our guests.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Susan,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. If you can confirm at least 150 guests, we can adjust the price to $70 per person, which still includes VAT and all setup and staffing. As for the menu, I recommend our herb-crusted salmon and roasted vegetable medley, as they tend to be crowd favorites.  

We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, and I’ll ensure that gluten-free and vegan options are available for those who require them. Regarding beverages, if you decide to include a bar service, we can work out a package that fits your needs.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can finalize the arrangements soon.  

Best,

I would also like to include the bar service and will follow up with you on the specific details shortly. Please let me know about the cancellation policy and any further steps we need to take.  

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to working together to make this event a success.
