Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming gala. We specialize in catering events like yours and would love to assist in making it memorable.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we typically offer a selection of gourmet dishes that can be tailored to your preferences. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes a variety of meat and dairy options, along with appetizers and desserts. We ensure all our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din, guaranteeing that dietary needs are met.  

While our standard menu includes a bar service, I would like to confirm if you would like us to provide beverages as well. Please note that VAT is included in the pricing.  

I’d love to discuss this further and hear about any specific dietary accommodations you might require for your guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information on your services. The gala is scheduled for March 15th, and we expect around 120 guests. The price of £45 per person seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there is any flexibility in that rate, especially if we decide to go with a set menu or a larger group.  

Additionally, we would like to include a range of dietary options, specifically vegetarian and gluten-free dishes, to accommodate all our guests. Could you confirm if these can be included in the final menu?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,  
Rachel Green

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Given the size of your event, I can offer you a discounted rate of £40 per person if you decide to confirm the catering for 150 guests. This will help us streamline the menu while providing a delightful experience.  

We can certainly accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options within the menu, ensuring that all dietary needs are met. However, please note that we require a final guest count two weeks before the event to finalize the arrangements.  

Regarding cancellation, we have a standard policy that allows cancellations up to seven days prior to the event with a full refund. After that, we will retain a 25% deposit.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed.  

Best regards,
