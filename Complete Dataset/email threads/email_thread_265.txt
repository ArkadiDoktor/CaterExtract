Dear Julia,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. We specialize in a variety of menus and can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, as well as vegetarian dishes.  

For pricing, our rates are set at $75 per person, and this includes setup and staffing for the duration of the event. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Our prices are inclusive of VAT. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local kosher authority.  

If you would like to include a bar service, we can arrange that for an additional cost. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let us know if there are any specific needs.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing you provided is competitive, but I was hoping to negotiate it a bit. Would you be open to $65 per person? Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 includes beverages or if those are charged separately?  

I appreciate the kosher option as well, but I need to confirm that it’s under the right supervision for our guests.

Dear Julia,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget considerations. While I cannot reduce the price to $65 per person, I can offer a package deal at $70, which will still include the setup, staffing, and a selection of beverages. The kosher meals will indeed be under the supervision of the local authority, ensuring they meet your guests' expectations.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu options.  

Best,
