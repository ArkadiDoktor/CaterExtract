Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding your upcoming gala on March 15th. We would love to provide the catering services for this special occasion. Our team specializes in a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and vegetarian options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For events of this nature, we typically charge £45 per person, which covers a full three-course meal, including starters, mains, and desserts. This price includes VAT and allows for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions—just let us know your guests' needs.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further or if you have any specific menu items in mind.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the initial details. The gala is indeed a significant event for us, and we are looking for a memorable experience for our guests. I appreciate your menu options and the kosher supervision details.  

However, I was hoping to get the pricing down a bit, as our budget is quite tight. Would you be able to offer a slightly lower rate if we guarantee 150 guests? Additionally, can you confirm whether beverages are included in this price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and for sharing your budget considerations. We can adjust the rate to £40 per person for 150 guests, which still includes the full three-course meal and VAT. However, please note that beverages and bar services are not included in this price. We can provide a separate beverage package if that would be of interest.  

I hope this adjustment works for you, and I look forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for accommodating our budget. I’m happy to confirm the catering at £40 per person for 150 guests, which totals £6,000. We will also need to discuss the beverage package you mentioned. Please reserve the date for us, and I will send over the final guest count and any dietary requirements as we get closer to the event.  

Regarding cancellation, could you clarify your policy? Once I have that, we can finalize everything.  

Thanks again for your cooperation!  

Best,
