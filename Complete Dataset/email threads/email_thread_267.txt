Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm excited about the possibility of working together for the bar mitzvah. The pricing seems reasonable; however, I was wondering if you could provide a few specific menu highlights. I want to make sure there’s something for everyone, especially for those with dietary restrictions.  

Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in the $45 per person price, or will that be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can assure you that our menu features a delectable selection, including chicken marbella, roasted vegetable platters, and chocolate mousse for dessert. We can also provide vegan and gluten-free options upon request.  

Regarding beverages, we typically offer a bar service separately, so drinks would not be included in the $45 per person price. However, if you prefer a package that includes beverages, I can prepare a custom quote for you.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the menu highlights and the clarification regarding the beverages. I appreciate your flexibility. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the catering at the price of $45 per person for 75 guests, which brings us to a total of $3,375. We understand that beverages will be an additional cost and are fine with that.  

Please confirm the arrangement, including the cancellation policy, and any additional notes for setup and staffing.  

Thank you once again, and I look forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
