Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to introduce our catering services at Gourmet Delights. We specialize in a variety of events and can provide a menu tailored to your specific needs. We understand you are organizing a corporate gala on May 15th, and we would love to assist you in making it a memorable occasion.  

Our catering packages are priced at $50 per person, and we can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests. We offer a mixed menu with options for both meat and dairy, and all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. Additionally, beverages can be included for an extra fee.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The price per person sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit on the total budget. Given our expected guest count, a fixed price of $8,000 would work better for us. Can we adjust the menu to meet this budget while still ensuring a great experience?  

Also, could you clarify if VAT is included in your pricing? We want to ensure there are no surprises later on.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and for considering our services. I understand your budgetary constraints. We can customize the menu to fit the $8,000 target, ensuring that we maintain quality while accommodating your needs.  

Regarding VAT, our pricing does not include it, so it will be added on top of the total. If you would prefer a more detailed menu outline, I can prepare a few options for your review.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I’ll finalize the details accordingly.  

Best,
