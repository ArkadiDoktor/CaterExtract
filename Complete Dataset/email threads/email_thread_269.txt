Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing tailored catering services for events like yours, and I would be delighted to assist you.  

Our offerings can include a range of options from a mixed menu featuring meat and dairy dishes to fully pareve selections. For your event, I recommend our signature beef tenderloin and a selection of vegetarian appetizers. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT.  

If you need any specific dietary accommodations, such as gluten-free or vegan options, please let me know. We can also provide a full bar service at an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the prompt reply. The menu options sound enticing! However, we are looking for a more affordable solution. Could you offer a fixed price for up to 100 guests? We are also considering a simpler menu with fewer premium items, perhaps focusing on the vegetarian options.  

Additionally, please confirm if the food will be kosher and the supervision details, as this is important for our attendees.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. For a fixed price, I can offer a package for 100 guests at $4,200, which includes a variety of vegetarian dishes like roasted vegetable platters and pasta primavera, along with the beef tenderloin as an option for meat eaters. The food will indeed be kosher, supervised under the local rabbinical authority.  

If you decide to add a bar service, it would be an additional $1,200. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than two weeks in advance.  

Let me know if this fits your budget, and I will prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,
