Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. We offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed menu featuring meat and dairy dishes, all under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which typically ranges from $50 to $75 depending on the selected menu items. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, with a minimum of 100 guests required. Please note that VAT is included in our pricing.  

In addition to the food, we can also provide beverage options, including a full bar or a selection of wines, if you choose. We are happy to discuss specific dietary accommodations as well to ensure all your guests are well catered to.  

Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or if you have any other questions.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed information. The mixed menu sounds perfect for our wedding. However, I was wondering if you could provide a fixed price for 120 guests. Additionally, while I appreciate the inclusion of VAT, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the per-person rate?  

Also, could you give me an idea of some specific dishes you would recommend? We are particularly interested in options that can accommodate gluten-free and nut-free diets.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. For 120 guests, we can offer a fixed price of $6,500, which includes the full bar service. As for the menu, I would recommend our roasted chicken with herb sauce, a selection of grilled vegetables, and a delicious gluten-free quinoa salad. We can also prepare nut-free options to ensure all dietary needs are met.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,  
David
