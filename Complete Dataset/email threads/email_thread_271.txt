Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting around 120 guests for the bar mitzvah and would like to include a variety of dishes to cater to different tastes. Ideally, we would prefer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options.  

Could you clarify if the fifty dollars per person includes VAT? Also, I’d like to know if you provide beverages or if that would be an additional cost. Lastly, what are your cancellation terms?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for providing the details. Yes, the pricing of fifty dollars per person does include VAT. We offer a mixed menu featuring items such as beef brisket, grilled chicken, and a selection of vegetarian dishes. Beverages are not included in the base price, but we can arrange a bar service for an additional twenty dollars per person.  

Regarding cancellation, we require at least two weeks' notice to avoid any fees. If you confirm the guest count and menu by September 28th, we can lock in the price for 120 guests.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
