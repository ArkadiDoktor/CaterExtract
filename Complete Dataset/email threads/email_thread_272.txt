Our pricing structure is typically based on a per-person rate, which ranges from $50 to $75 depending on the menu selection. We specialize in mixed cuisine and can accommodate up to 300 guests.  

We pride ourselves on using high-quality ingredients, and our dishes can be tailored to fit dietary restrictions. We would be happy to provide a few sample menu options that include both meat and vegetarian choices. Additionally, we can ensure that all our offerings are kosher under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided. For the gala, we're expecting between 150 to 200 guests, and I am particularly interested in a menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options. Could you provide a few examples of the dishes you offer?  

I understand your pricing ranges from $50 to $75 per person. If we were to go with a fixed price, what would that look like for 175 guests? Also, does the pricing include VAT? Lastly, we will need a bar service for the evening, so I'm curious if that can be arranged as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For a fixed price, I can offer $65 per person for 175 guests, which would total $11,375. This includes VAT, and I can ensure that the menu features a variety of dishes such as grilled chicken with herbs, a hearty vegetable lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads.  

As for the bar, we can set up a full bar service at an additional cost of $1,500, which includes all beverages and staff. We can also provide a range of kosher wines under the same supervision as our food. Please confirm if this meets your needs, and we can finalize the details.
