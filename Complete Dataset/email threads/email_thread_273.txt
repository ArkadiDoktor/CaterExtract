Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if the $45 per person includes VAT, or if that would be added on top of the total? Additionally, we are also considering a beverage service. Is that something you typically include in your packages, or would it be an extra cost?  

I appreciate your flexibility in accommodating dietary restrictions. Could you provide some examples of dishes that might be included in the menu?  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The price of $45 per person does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. As for beverages, we can offer a bar service for an additional $15 per person, or you can opt for a non-alcoholic beverage package starting at $10 per person.  

For your menu, I can suggest items like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of salads and sides. We can also create a dessert table with assorted pastries and fresh fruit. If you confirm the number of guests, I can finalize the menu options.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing and beverage options. After discussing with my team, we would like to go ahead with the catering. We expect around 100 guests, which brings the total to $6,000, including VAT. We will also include the bar service for an additional $1,500.  

Please send over the contract with the cancellation terms, and let’s finalize the menu selections. I am looking forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Best regards,
