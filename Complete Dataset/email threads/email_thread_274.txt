Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding on September 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide catering for this special occasion. Our team specializes in creating memorable dining experiences, and we can offer a diverse menu that caters to various dietary needs.

For your event, we typically offer a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and dessert. This pricing can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. We can provide kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union if that aligns with your needs. Additionally, our packages can include beverages, but they are priced separately.

If you could provide more details about your anticipated guest count and any specific menu preferences, we can tailor our proposal to fit your vision.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response. The fixed price of $75 per person sounds reasonable, but I am concerned about the total cost if we decide to have closer to 150 guests. Could you confirm if the price includes VAT or if it is added on top? Also, since this is a wedding, we would prefer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.

It would be helpful to know if you can accommodate vegan and gluten-free dietary requests. Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy in case our plans change?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your questions. The price of $75 per person does include VAT, which should help with your budgeting. If you decide on the maximum of 150 guests, the total would come to $11,250. 

We can absolutely provide a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy dishes, and we can also accommodate vegan and gluten-free options upon request. As for the cancellation policy, we typically require a notice of at least 30 days for a full refund of any deposits made.

Please let me know if you need any more details or if you would like to proceed with securing the date.

Best,
