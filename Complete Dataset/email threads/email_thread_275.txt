Dear Sarah,  
I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to provide you with a catering proposal for the upcoming charity gala you are organizing on March 15th. We specialize in a range of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is set at $65 per person, which includes setup and staffing, and we can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests.  
Additionally, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Star-K, and we can provide a selection of beverages as part of the package. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I can tailor the menu accordingly.  
Looking forward to your thoughts.  
Best regards,

Hi David,  
Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The pricing looks reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if the $65 per person includes VAT or if it would be added on top. Also, could you confirm whether you offer any vegan options for guests with dietary restrictions? Lastly, we are aiming for around 120 guests, but we might have a few more. Would that still work within the same pricing structure?

Hello Sarah,  
Thank you for your follow-up. The $65 per person does include VAT, so there won’t be any surprises there. We can certainly accommodate vegan options as well, ensuring that all dietary needs are met. As for the guest count, we can easily handle 120 guests, and we can stretch to 150 without any additional charge. Please let me know if you would like to proceed, and I can draft a formal agreement.  
Warm regards,
