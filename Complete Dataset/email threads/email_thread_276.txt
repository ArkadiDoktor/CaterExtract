Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to hear about your upcoming wedding celebration on November 15th at the Grand Hotel. We specialize in catering for events like yours and would love to provide a menu that complements your special day.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at 55 dollars per person, with a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT. We offer a mixed menu with options for meat and dairy, and we can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like more details on our menu items or if you have any specific requests. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding your catering services. I appreciate the pricing structure; however, is there any flexibility on the per-person cost if we exceed the minimum guest count? We are anticipating closer to 175 guests.  

Additionally, could you clarify whether beverages are included in that price? We are also considering adding a bar service if that’s an option.  

Looking forward to hearing back soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can offer a reduced rate of 50 dollars per person for any guests beyond the 100 minimum, which will help accommodate your larger group. Regarding beverages, our package does not include bar service, but we can certainly arrange a full bar for an additional cost.  

If you choose to go with our catering, I can assure you the setup will be seamless, with staff available for service throughout the event. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement.
