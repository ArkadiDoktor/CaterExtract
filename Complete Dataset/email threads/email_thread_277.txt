Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the catering for the wedding event scheduled for March 15, 2024. We specialize in providing high-quality kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary laws are strictly observed.  

Our menu options include a variety of dishes, with a focus on meat and dairy selections, but we can also accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free diets upon request. We typically charge $75 per person, and our services include setup and staffing for the event. Please note that this price does not include beverages, but we can arrange for a full bar service if desired.  

If you expect between 100 and 150 guests, we would be happy to finalize the details and provide a more tailored menu. The final price would include VAT.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The wedding is indeed a significant occasion for us, and we want to ensure everything is perfect. Your kosher options sound great, but could you clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT? Additionally, we are considering a guest list of around 120, so I want to ensure that works within your pricing structure.  

Lastly, while I appreciate that beverages are not included, could you provide an estimate for the cost of a bar service for the event?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Yes, the $75 per person does include VAT. For a bar service, we can offer a package that starts at $25 per guest, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. If you would like to explore more premium options, we can provide a customized quote.  

Regarding the number of guests, 120 is perfectly manageable, and I can prepare a menu that highlights some of our best dishes. Should you wish to proceed, please keep in mind our cancellation policy, which allows for a full refund if canceled at least 30 days prior to the event.  

Let me know how you would like to move forward.

Let’s make this an unforgettable event. I look forward to working together to finalize the details.
