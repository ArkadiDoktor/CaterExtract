Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would love to assist you in making this event a success.  

Our catering service provides a diverse menu, and I can offer a mixed menu option featuring both meat and dairy dishes. We typically charge a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing, and we can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests. All prices quoted will include VAT.  

We also have options for dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes. If you would like, I can send over a sample menu for your review.  

Please let me know if you have any specific requests or questions. I'm looking forward to your response.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the inclusion of dietary accommodations. However, I was hoping to get a more specific idea of the dishes you would be serving. Can you provide a couple of examples?  

Also, we might have a few more guests than initially expected, possibly reaching up to 250. Would you be able to cater for that number, and would the price remain the same? Lastly, could you confirm if your food is kosher and under what supervision?  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. We can certainly accommodate up to 250 guests, and the price would remain at $75 per person, even at that capacity. As for the menu, I can suggest dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, a selection of seasonal vegetables, and a variety of desserts, including a chocolate mousse.  

I can confirm that our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all necessary standards. Regarding beverages, the catering package does not include a bar service, but we can arrange that for an additional fee if desired.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and if you have any further queries.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the detailed information. I’m pleased to confirm our agreement for 250 guests at the rate of $75 per person. This includes the mixed menu you outlined, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details.  

I would like to request a couple of additional options for dietary needs and would love to discuss potential arrangements for drinks separately. I understand the cancellation policy is standard, but could you please confirm the specific terms once again?  

Looking forward to finalizing everything.  

Best wishes,
