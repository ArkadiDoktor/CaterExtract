Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the catering options for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in a variety of culinary experiences and can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and we offer a selection of dishes such as roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a decadent dessert bar. All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by Rabbi Cohen, ensuring they meet all dietary laws.  

While we do not provide a bar service as part of our package, we can recommend a reliable vendor for beverage services. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary accommodations needed for your guests.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate the kosher supervision by Rabbi Cohen, and the menu options sound appealing. However, I wanted to clarify if there is any flexibility on the pricing, especially if we finalize the guest count closer to the maximum limit. Additionally, could you let me know if there are any specific cancellation terms we should be aware of?

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need for flexibility. We can adjust the price to a fixed rate of $47 per person if you confirm a minimum of 150 guests. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to two weeks before the event, which should provide you with peace of mind.  

Let me know if this works for your budget, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
