Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt reply and the pricing details. The $50 per person rate sounds reasonable, but I wanted to check if there is any flexibility with the menu options, particularly regarding kosher supervision. We have a few attendees who require kosher meals.  

Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in that price? I will need to confirm how many guests we expect, but I anticipate around 80. Is there a possibility to adjust the menu based on our dietary needs?  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your updated proposal.

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. We can certainly provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local kosher authority, ensuring that all dietary restrictions are met. The $50 per person price includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, but beverages are not included. We can discuss a bar package if that is something you're interested in.  

For the menu, we can offer a variety of options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of seasonal salads, all of which can be tailored to your needs. Regarding the guest count, we can adjust the final price based on the final number, and I can assure you that with 80 guests, we will have everything in place for a successful event.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this or if you have any further questions.  

Best,

I would like to move forward with the catering for 80 guests at $50 per person. Please confirm that the total will be $4,000, inclusive of VAT and that your cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.
