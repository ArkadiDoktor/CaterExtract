Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th at the Grand Oak Venue. We would be delighted to provide catering services for such a special occasion.  

Our offerings include a diverse menu that can be tailored to your preferences. We specialize in mixed cuisine, featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

All food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards. While we do not provide a bar service, we can suggest local vendors for beverages. We are also able to accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Should you have any specific dishes in mind or questions about setup and staffing, please let me know. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the details. Everything sounds great so far, but I was wondering if you could offer a slight discount considering we are expecting around 120 guests. Additionally, could you clarify your cancellation policy?  

We are particularly interested in including a few signature dishes, like your grilled salmon and the chocolate mousse, if they could fit into the budget. I appreciate your help and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your inquiry regarding the pricing. For a guest count of 120, I can offer a revised price of $70 per person, which still includes VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event, which I hope provides some flexibility.  

As for the menu, the grilled salmon and chocolate mousse can certainly be included. We will ensure that all dishes are prepared with the utmost care to meet your expectations. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Warm regards,
