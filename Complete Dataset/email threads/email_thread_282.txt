Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala scheduled for March 15th, and I would love to provide catering services for this event. We specialize in a variety of menus, including kosher options, and can accommodate both meat and dairy preferences.  

Our pricing generally starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests. Please note that VAT is included in the quoted price.  

If you're interested, I can send over a sample menu and discuss any specific dietary requirements you might have. Additionally, we can arrange for beverages, but they would be an extra cost.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm if the kosher meals are under strict supervision. It's important for us to ensure compliance.  

Additionally, could you clarify if the $50 per person includes any specific menu items, or is it more of a starting point? I would also like to know if you can provide options for vegetarian guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your questions. I'm happy to confirm that our kosher meals are prepared under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council. The $50 per person rate is indeed a starting point, and we can tailor the menu to include specific items such as grilled salmon, roasted vegetables, and a variety of desserts.  

For vegetarian guests, we can definitely provide options such as stuffed bell peppers and a quinoa salad. If we finalize the details soon, I can ensure everything is set for your event.  

Just a reminder, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks prior to the event date. Please let me know if you have any other concerns.

Please prepare a mixed menu that accommodates both meat and vegetarian options, and include a few beverage choices separately. I also acknowledge the cancellation terms you've shared.
