Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your quick response. I'm excited about the menu options you've shared. Since we expect a minimum of 80 and a maximum of 120 guests, I wanted to confirm that the pricing remains consistent throughout that range. Additionally, could you clarify if the £30 per person includes VAT?  

Lastly, can you confirm if beverages and a bar service are included in that price? We might want to ensure that our guests have a selection of drinks available.  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The pricing of £30 per person does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total. As for beverages, we can offer a separate bar package, but it is not included in the meal price.  

If you prefer, we can provide a range of drinks packages starting at £15 per person. You can also adjust this depending on the final guest count. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a detailed proposal.  

Best,
