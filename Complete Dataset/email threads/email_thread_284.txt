Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate seminar on April 15th. I am excited to provide a proposal tailored to your needs. We specialize in a diverse menu, including meat and dairy options, and can certainly accommodate any dietary restrictions your guests may have.  

Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes a wide selection of dishes, such as roasted chicken with seasonal vegetables and a gourmet pasta station. We can handle a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests comfortably. Please note that pricing does not include VAT, which will be added at the current rate.  

We also offer a full bar service, should you require it, but it is separate from the base catering price. Our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring compliance with dietary laws.  

I look forward to discussing your specific requirements in detail.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided, especially regarding the kosher supervision and menu options. Before we move forward, could you let me know if there’s flexibility on the price per person? Our budget is a bit tight, and I was hoping to keep it closer to $40 per person. Additionally, we will likely have around 100 guests.  

Also, could you confirm what specific dietary accommodations you can offer? We have some guests who might need vegetarian options, and I want to ensure they are well catered for.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to stay within budget, and I can reduce the price to $42 per person if you confirm the minimum of 100 guests. This includes a selection of vegetarian dishes alongside the meat options.  

Regarding the dietary accommodations, we can provide gluten-free choices as well, ensuring all guests are catered for. I would like to remind you that the quoted price does not include VAT.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement for your review.
