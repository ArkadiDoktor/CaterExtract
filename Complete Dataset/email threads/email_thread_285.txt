Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We would love the opportunity to cater this event for you. Our catering services are designed to create memorable experiences, and we can provide a delicious menu that includes a variety of options.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring grilled chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a selection of salads. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes all food preparation and service staff. This rate accommodates a minimum of 30 guests and can go up to 150 guests. Please note that the quoted price includes VAT.  

We are happy to provide kosher options under the supervision of Rabbi Cohen, and we can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian or gluten-free requests. However, our package does not include beverages or a bar setup, which can be arranged separately if needed.  

I look forward to your feedback so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu you suggested sounds great, especially the grilled chicken. However, I am concerned about the per-person cost, as our budget is a bit tight. Is there any flexibility in the pricing? Additionally, could you confirm if we can include a small beverage service, perhaps just soft drinks and water, without significantly increasing the overall cost?  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate your consideration. We can certainly adjust the menu to include a more budget-friendly option, perhaps by offering a simpler selection of dishes or reducing the portions slightly. If we include soft drinks and water, we can do so for an additional $5 per person, bringing the total to $50 per person.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a revised quote. We want to make sure you have everything you need for a successful event.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility and for accommodating my requests. The revised total of $50 per person, including the beverages, works for us. I would like to confirm the catering for 60 guests, bringing the total to $3,000. Please proceed with the arrangements, and let me know if you need any additional information from my side.  

Looking forward to working together to make this event a success.
