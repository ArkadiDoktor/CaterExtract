For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with highlights including herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a delectable chocolate mousse for dessert. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, with a pricing structure of $45 per person, which includes VAT.  

Our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary laws are observed. Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages and a fully stocked bar for an additional fee.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher certification as it aligns with our company’s requirements. However, I wanted to clarify if your price of $45 per person includes the bar service or if that would be an additional charge.  

Also, if we decide to go ahead, what is the cancellation policy? I would like to ensure we have flexibility leading up to the event.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The quoted price of $45 per person does not include the bar service; that would be an additional $15 per person. As for the cancellation policy, you would need to provide at least two weeks' notice for a full refund. After that period, we would retain a 50% cancellation fee.  

If you have specific drink preferences for the bar, I would be happy to discuss options that fit your budget. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best wishes,
