Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing and menu sound promising. However, I would like to confirm if the meals will be prepared under kosher supervision. Additionally, do you offer any beverage options, or is that something we need to arrange separately? 

If we proceed with the minimum number of guests at 50, what would the total cost look like after considering dietary accommodations? 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. I can confirm that our meals are indeed kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar service in our catering packages, but we can arrange a selection of soft drinks and juices if desired. 

For the minimum of 50 guests, the total would be $2,250, which includes VAT and accommodates dietary requests. Should you need an open bar, that would be an additional charge, depending on the specific beverages selected. 

Please let me know if this meets your needs or if you have any further questions. 

Best regards,
