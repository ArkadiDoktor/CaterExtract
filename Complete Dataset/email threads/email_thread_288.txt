Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu items sound great, and I appreciate your flexibility in accommodating dietary needs. However, I was hoping to explore the possibility of a fixed price for the entire event instead of a per-person rate, as this would help us manage our budget better.  

Additionally, could you confirm whether the food will be kosher? Our organization requires kosher supervision for our events. It would also be helpful to know if beverages are included in the pricing or if that would be an extra cost.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the pricing structure. We can offer a fixed price of $4,500 for up to 100 guests, which will include the menu options I previously outlined, as well as soft drinks. If you need an open bar, we can provide that at an additional cost.   

I can confirm that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if cancelled more than two weeks before the event date. Please let me know if this arrangement works for you or if you have any further questions.  

Best,
