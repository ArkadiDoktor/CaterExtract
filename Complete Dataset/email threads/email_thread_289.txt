Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the pricing details. However, I am wondering if there is any flexibility in the pricing if we reach the lower end of the guest count, say closer to 50, rather than 150? Also, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes VAT?  

I am considering including a bar service for the event, so I need to know if that would be an additional cost.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. We can offer a fixed price of $40 per person if you confirm a minimum of 50 guests. The initial pricing does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the total. Regarding the bar service, we can provide a premium open bar at an additional $15 per person, with a selection of wines, beers, and spirits.  

Our team is committed to ensuring your gala is a memorable event, and we can discuss any additional details you may have regarding setup and dietary accommodations.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I would like to proceed with the catering for 50 guests at the rate of $40 per person, plus VAT, and I would also like to include the premium open bar service. This brings the total to $2,750, which I accept.  

Please confirm that the food is kosher under the local rabbinical supervision, and let me know the cancellation policy. I look forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the details.  

Best,
