Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We are excited about the possibility of catering this event. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can cater to various dietary needs, including options for vegetarian and gluten-free guests.  

For a seated dinner, we typically recommend a three-course meal featuring a selection of meat, dairy, and pareve dishes. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which usually ranges from $60 to $90, depending on the final menu selection. This includes all serving equipment and staff for setup, service, and cleanup.  

All our meals can be prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OU, ensuring they meet your dietary requirements. However, please note that beverages are not included in the base pricing, but we can certainly provide bar services at an additional cost.  

If you have a rough estimate of your guest count, I would be happy to provide a more tailored quote.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed information. We are expecting between 120 to 150 guests for the gala dinner. With that in mind, could you provide a more specific quote based on this estimated guest count?  

Also, I want to clarify that we would require the food to be entirely kosher, and it would be great if you could confirm that all dishes are suitable for our guests with dietary restrictions. Additionally, could you let me know if VAT is included in your pricing?  

I appreciate your help and look forward to your updated proposal.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for the clarification regarding the guest count. For 135 guests, the total cost would come to $8,400, which does include VAT. All dishes will be kosher, prepared under the supervision of the OU, and we can easily accommodate dietary restrictions.  

The menu can feature highlights such as herb-crusted chicken, a creamy mushroom risotto, and a vibrant vegetable medley, along with a dessert selection. As previously mentioned, beverages are not included in the base price, but we can arrange a full bar service for an additional $2,500.  

Please let me know if this fits within your budget or if you would like to discuss any adjustments.  

Best regards,
