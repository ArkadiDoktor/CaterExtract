Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher meals and would love to assist you in making your event memorable.  

For a wedding, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options, all under strict rabbinical supervision. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can also provide a selection of beverages, though bar service is an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or menu items in mind, and I will be happy to provide a more detailed proposal.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your detailed proposal. The menu options sound great, and I appreciate your flexibility with the guest count. I would like to clarify a few points before moving forward.  

Could you provide some examples of your representative menu items? Also, what options do you offer for dietary accommodations? Lastly, is the $45 per person a fixed price, or is there room for negotiation?  

I look forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. Our representative menu items include herb-marinated chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads. We can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options as well.  

Regarding the pricing, we can adjust it slightly depending on the final menu selection, but I would recommend sticking close to the $45 per person for simplicity. If you have a specific budget in mind, please let me know, and we can work something out.  

Please also note that our cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event without penalty.  

Looking forward to your feedback.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the quick follow-up and the menu details. I appreciate your flexibility with the pricing, but we were hoping to keep our budget under $40 per person. If you can accommodate that, we would be ready to finalize the agreement for 100 guests.  

Please confirm if this would work for you, and we can proceed with the paperwork.  

Thanks again,
