Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in catering events like yours and would love to provide you with an exceptional dining experience.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of dishes such as grilled chicken, quinoa salad, and assorted pastries. Our price structure is typically set at $45 per person, which covers a three-course meal, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. This price includes VAT, but beverages are not included.  

All our food is kosher, under supervision from the local rabbinical council. Should you need any dietary accommodations, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options, we are more than happy to assist.  

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. I appreciate the information about the mixed menu and dietary accommodations. However, I am wondering if there is any flexibility in pricing, particularly if we decide to have a larger number of guests. Additionally, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes dessert, or if that is considered an extra?  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can certainly offer a reduced rate of $40 per person if your guest count exceeds 100 people. The dessert is included in the price, so there won't be any additional charges for that.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement. We can also discuss setup times and staffing requirements based on your final guest count.  

Best regards,

I look forward to working together to make this event a success!
