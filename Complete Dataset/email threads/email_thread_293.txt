Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this elegant event. Our team specializes in creating memorable dining experiences, and we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

For a guest count between 50 to 150, our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing. We can also accommodate any dietary restrictions you may have, ensuring that all your guests are well taken care of. Please note that our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

If you would like beverages included, we can discuss a bar package as well. VAT is included in the pricing, and we have a cancellation policy allowing for full refunds up to two weeks before the event.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided about the mixed menu and the kosher certification. However, I would like to confirm if the $75 price includes a bar package as well, or if that is an additional cost. Additionally, we are expecting around 100 guests, so could you provide a quote that includes a bar if it’s separate?  

Also, I’d like to ensure there are vegan options available within the menu, considering some of our attendees have dietary restrictions.  

Thanks again, and I look forward to your updates.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person does not include the bar package, which would be an additional $20 per person. For your anticipated 100 guests, the total would then be $7,500 for the food and $2,000 for the bar, bringing the grand total to $9,500.  

We absolutely can include vegan options within the menu, and I will ensure they are highlighted in our final proposal. Just to clarify, the bar would include a selection of beers, wines, and soft drinks.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare the final contract.  

Best,

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to a successful event.
