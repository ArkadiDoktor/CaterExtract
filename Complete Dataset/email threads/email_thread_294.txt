Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. We are planning for approximately 150 guests and would like to see a sample menu. While I’m comfortable with the per-person pricing, I was hoping to find out if VAT is included in that price. Additionally, could you clarify if your staff will handle setup and breakdown of the event?  

I’m also interested in the bar service you mentioned, so please include any details about that as well.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I’m glad to hear about the guest count! The $45 per person pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top. Our staff will indeed handle the setup and breakdown, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the day of the event.  

For the bar service, we can provide a selection of wines and spirits for an additional $15 per person. I’ll send over a sample menu shortly, including some highlights like our herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetable platter. Please let me know if you’d like to move forward with the details we’ve discussed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing structure and the details about the bar service. After reviewing everything, I’d like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests at the agreed price of $45 per person, plus VAT. Please confirm that the total cost will be $6,750, which includes the setup and breakdown, and that we can expect the menu to feature both meat and vegetarian dishes.  

Also, could you please provide your cancellation policy? I look forward to receiving the final agreement and the menu.
