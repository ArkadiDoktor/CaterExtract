Dear Elizabeth,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special event.  

We offer a variety of menu options, ranging from traditional meat dishes to a more contemporary selection. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or any dietary restrictions your guests may have. Our packages can also be customized to include beverages, though they are not included in the base price.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the information you provided. Since we expect around 100 guests, I’d like to discuss the menu options further. Could you provide a few highlights of what you recommend, especially any vegetarian choices?  

Also, is the price of $45 per person inclusive of VAT, or will that be added on top? We’re particularly interested in ensuring that all dietary needs are met without compromising on quality.  

Best,  
Elizabeth

Hi Elizabeth,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly provide a few menu highlights. For your event, I recommend our herb-crusted roast chicken and a delightful quinoa salad for vegetarian options. Both are crowd-pleasers.  

Regarding pricing, the $45 per person does include VAT. However, beverage service would be an additional fee, which can vary based on your selection. If you can confirm the number of guests, we can finalize the details and ensure we meet all dietary restrictions.  

Let me know if you’d like to proceed or if you have any other questions.  

Best wishes,  
David

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification and the menu suggestions. I would like to move forward with your services for 100 guests at the agreed price of $45 per person, including VAT. Please prepare the kosher meals and ensure that the vegetarian options are available for those who need them.  

Could you also include a non-alcoholic beverage package? We will finalize the guest count two weeks prior to the event. I understand the cancellation policy is flexible, but could you confirm the specifics?  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
