Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel Cohen, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. We specialize in providing top-notch catering services for various events, including corporate functions, weddings, and private parties.  

I understand you are planning a bar mitzvah event on March 15th and would love to assist you in making it memorable. We offer a diverse menu that can be tailored to meet your needs, including kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes appetizers, main courses, and desserts, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

I would be happy to discuss your specific requirements and any dietary accommodations needed. Please let me know a good time for us to chat.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Cohen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The bar mitzvah is indeed a significant occasion for us, and we appreciate your willingness to help. I would like to confirm that we will need kosher meals, and I’m glad to hear that you can provide them.  

However, $45 per person is a bit higher than we anticipated. Would you be able to offer a price closer to $40 per person? Additionally, can you clarify if beverages are included in this price? We are expecting around 80 guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,  
Sarah Johnson

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the need to manage costs, especially for such a significant event. I can adjust the price to $42 per person, which still allows us to maintain the quality of our offerings.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include them in our base price, but I can certainly offer a beverage package at an additional $10 per person. This would include soft drinks, juices, and water. We can also provide a selection of meat dishes, including grilled chicken and beef brisket, along with vegetarian options if needed.  

Please let me know if this works for your budget.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the pricing. I appreciate the revised amount of $42 per person, and I am happy to accept that along with the beverage package for $10 per person. Therefore, the total will come to $4,160 for 80 guests, which I believe is reasonable.  

Please confirm that these meals will be kosher as discussed, and let me know about the cancellation policy. I look forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Best,
