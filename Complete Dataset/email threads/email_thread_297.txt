Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on September 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our offerings include a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

We typically charge $75 per person, which includes VAT. For your event, we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Additionally, we offer various dietary accommodations, including gluten-free and vegetarian options.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. Before we finalize anything, could you clarify whether your price includes beverages? We are considering a bar service and would like to know if that can be included or if it comes at an additional cost.  

Also, would it be possible to review a sample menu? We want to ensure the dishes align with our guests' preferences. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person price does not include a bar service; we can arrange a separate package for beverages if you’d like. I can send you a sample menu that highlights some of our most popular dishes, including brisket, roasted vegetables, and a selection of dairy desserts.  

If we can finalize the guest count, I can also provide a more tailored quote for the bar service. Please let me know your thoughts, and I’m here to help with any questions.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarification regarding the bar service. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the catering at the $75 per person rate for 100 guests, which totals $7,500. We would also like to include the bar service you mentioned. Please confirm if the final price will include VAT as discussed.  

We appreciate your assistance and look forward to seeing the sample menu. Please also provide the cancellation policy for our records.  

Best regards,
