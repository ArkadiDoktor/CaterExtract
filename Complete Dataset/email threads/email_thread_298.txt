Dear David,  

Thank you for your swift response. The menu options sound fantastic. I would like to confirm that we will need to accommodate some dietary restrictions, primarily vegetarian and gluten-free options. Is that something you can provide?  

Additionally, could you clarify if beverages are included in the price? We would also like to know about your cancellation policy, as it is essential for our planning.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. We can certainly accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options, such as quinoa-stuffed peppers and seasonal vegetable platters. However, the pricing I provided earlier does not include beverages. If you would like to include a bar service, we can discuss a separate package based on your needs.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund. If you cancel within that time frame, we retain a 25% deposit.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I’d be glad to finalize the details.  

Best,
