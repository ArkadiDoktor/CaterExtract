Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision information. However, we are expecting around 150 attendees, and I would like to confirm if you can accommodate this number.  

Also, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes VAT or if that will be added later? We are considering options for beverages and might be interested in a few drink selections.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,
