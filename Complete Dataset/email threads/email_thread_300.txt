Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming gala event on April 15th. We specialize in catering for such occasions and would love to help make your event memorable.  

Our menu features a delightful selection of dishes, focusing on a mixed cuisine approach that includes both meat and dairy options. We ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, guaranteeing the highest standards.  

For pricing, we generally offer a rate of 75 dollars per person, which includes the full meal service and setup. We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests. Please note that this price includes VAT. Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, although a fully stocked bar can be arranged for an extra fee.  

If you are interested, I would be happy to send over a sample menu and discuss any specific dietary accommodations you might need.  

Looking forward to your feedback.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the kosher supervision information. However, I wanted to see if there might be any flexibility in the pricing. Our budget is a bit tighter, and we were hoping to get closer to 60 dollars per person.  

Additionally, I would like to confirm if you offer any vegan or gluten-free options for our guests who may require dietary accommodations.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand your budget constraints and can offer a revised rate of 65 dollars per person, which still includes the full meal service and VAT. We can certainly incorporate vegan and gluten-free options into the menu, ensuring that all guests are catered for.  

Regarding the bar service, we can provide a basic selection of beverages at no extra charge, but if you wish to have a full bar, that would require an additional arrangement.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a detailed menu for your review.  

Best,

Please consider this email as confirmation of our agreement.  

I would also like to confirm the setup time and staffing details so we can ensure everything runs smoothly on the day.
