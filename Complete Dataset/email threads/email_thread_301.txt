Additionally, our dishes are kosher and supervised under the Orthodox Union, ensuring compliance with dietary laws. We can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as well. Please let us know if you would like to include a beverage package, as it is not included in the base price.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds delicious, and I appreciate that you can cater to various dietary needs. However, I noticed that the base price does not include beverages, and I would like to explore options for a bar service as well.  

Could you let me know what the cost would be to add a bar package for approximately 150 guests? Additionally, please confirm if the quoted price includes VAT or if it will be added later.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the bar service. For a bar package including beer, wine, and soft drinks for 150 guests, we typically charge an additional $20 per person.  

As for VAT, I can confirm that the $75 per person price does not include VAT; it will be added at the standard rate. Therefore, the total would come to $90 per person with the bar included. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement.  

Best regards,

Please note that we will need your team to assist with setup and staffing on the day of the gala. Additionally, I’d like to confirm the cancellation policy in case of any unforeseen changes.
