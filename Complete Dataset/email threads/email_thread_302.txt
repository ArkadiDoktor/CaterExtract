Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding your request for catering services for the charity gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in providing a range of menu options tailored to suit various needs and preferences.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian dishes, along with full dietary accommodations to ensure all your guests are catered for. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing. Please note that this price does not include beverages, but we can arrange a bar service if you'd like.  

Additionally, all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din, ensuring it meets the highest standards. We typically handle events with a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. VAT is included in the pricing provided.  

Looking forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to discuss the per-person price a bit further. Given that we anticipate around 150 guests, would you be open to a slight adjustment in pricing? If we could bring it down to £40 per person, I believe that would help us make a decision more quickly.  

Also, could you clarify what a typical menu might include for this price? I want to ensure we have some crowd-pleasers on the list.  

Best,

Thank you for your follow-up. I understand the need to manage costs for your event, and I'm happy to offer the price adjustment to £40 per person for 150 guests. The final total would be £6,000, which includes VAT.  

As for the menu, we typically highlight dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, vegetable lasagna, Mediterranean salad, and a selection of seasonal desserts. We can also accommodate any specific dietary requests you might have.  

Please confirm if you’re ready to proceed with this arrangement, and we can finalize the details. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.
