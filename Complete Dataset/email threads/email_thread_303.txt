Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The range you provided fits within our budget, but we would prefer to have a clearer idea of what the final price would be if we chose certain items. Additionally, could you confirm whether VAT is included in your pricing? We anticipate around 150 guests, and it would be helpful to know the minimum and maximum guest limits you mentioned.  

We are also interested in including a beverage service, so if you could provide details on what you offer in that regard, it would be appreciated.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. If you opt for our mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, the final price for 150 guests would be $10,500. This price includes VAT. As for the beverage service, we can provide a full bar package for an additional $20 per person, which includes wine, beer, and non-alcoholic beverages.  

In terms of dietary accommodations, we can certainly cater to gluten-free and vegan requests. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed or if there are specific items you have in mind for the menu.
