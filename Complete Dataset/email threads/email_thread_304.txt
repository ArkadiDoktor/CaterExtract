Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide catering for your event. We specialize in a mixed menu that includes a variety of options suitable for all guests. Our pricing starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts.  

We ensure that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and we are happy to accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Please let us know the expected number of guests, as we can handle events ranging from 50 to 150 attendees.  

If you require a bar setup, we can provide that as well, but it would be an additional cost. All prices mentioned are inclusive of VAT. Once you confirm the details, we can finalize the menu and other arrangements.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for providing the initial details. I appreciate the kosher supervision and the dietary accommodations you're offering. We're expecting around 100 guests, and I am particularly interested in the range of menu options you can provide.  

Could you please send me a more detailed menu and clarify if the $50 per person includes everything, or if there are additional charges for staffing and equipment setup? Also, I would like to know about your cancellation policy in case of changes.  

Thank you, and I look forward to your update.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. The $50 per person covers the food and basic setup, while staffing and equipment rental would be an additional cost, typically around $15 per hour per staff member. We can provide a detailed menu showcasing our most popular items, including herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and assorted pastries.  

In terms of cancellation, we require at least two weeks' notice to avoid any fees. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this pricing structure or if you have specific adjustments in mind.  

Warm regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the additional information. After reviewing everything, I’m ready to confirm the catering for 100 guests at the rate of $50 per person, which totals $5,000. We will need two staff members for setup and service. Please include that in the final pricing.  

I also appreciate the cancellation policy and the detailed menu options you've provided. I look forward to receiving the contract and any next steps.
