Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu options sound fantastic. However, I was wondering if there is any flexibility in the pricing. We are expecting around 80 guests, and while we appreciate the $75 per person rate, our budget is a bit tighter. Could we possibly discuss a fixed price for the total event? Additionally, can you confirm if the bar service includes both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages?  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback. For your event with 80 guests, we can offer a fixed price of $6,000, which covers everything, including the kosher menu and VAT. This price includes a full selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages at the bar. We can adjust the menu to better suit your budget while still maintaining quality. Just let me know your preferences, and we can finalize the details.  

Best wishes,
