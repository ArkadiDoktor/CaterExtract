Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a few things. We are expecting about 120 guests, but we may have a few more, so could you confirm if there's flexibility in your guest count?  

I appreciate that the menu includes a three-course meal, but can you provide a few examples of specific dishes you would offer? Also, does the price include beverages, or would that be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions and I'm happy to clarify. We can certainly accommodate your guest count, with a maximum of 150. In terms of menu highlights, we could offer dishes like herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of gourmet desserts.  

As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our base package, but we can certainly arrange for a beverage station with soft drinks and coffee for an additional $15 per person.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best,
