Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making your special day memorable.  

We can offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, typically ranging from 50 to 75 dollars, depending on the final selections. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests and can provide kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Please let us know if you require any specific dietary accommodations, and we will do our best to meet those needs. Additionally, we can offer a beverage package, but it would be priced separately.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I am particularly interested in the mixed menu option and would like to confirm that the pricing includes VAT.  

Regarding the beverage package, could you provide more specifics on what that entails? Also, if we finalize the catering, I would like to clarify the cancellation policy, just in case.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear you’re interested in the mixed menu. To clarify, our pricing does include VAT. The beverage package typically includes assorted wines, soft drinks, and juices, and is priced at an additional 15 dollars per person.  

As for the cancellation policy, we offer a full refund if cancellation occurs at least 30 days before the event. Otherwise, a 50% charge will apply. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can provide a detailed menu for your review.
