Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss catering options for your upcoming wedding on July 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options, alongside delicious pareve dishes to accommodate your guests' dietary needs.  

Our pricing structure is flexible, with rates starting at $75 per person, which includes set up and staffing for your event. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

In terms of beverages, we offer a separate bar package, but it is not included in the initial pricing. I can provide a detailed menu and some popular dishes, such as herb-marinated chicken and roasted vegetable lasagna, upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requirements.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few details. Since we anticipate around 100 guests, could you confirm whether the $75 per person includes VAT? Additionally, we are considering a bar option as well, so I'd appreciate more insight into what you offer.  

Lastly, can you provide a few more specific menu items? It would help us make an informed decision.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your reply. To clarify, the $75 per person does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. For the bar, we offer packages starting at $25 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

As for the menu, we can include dishes such as beef brisket, spinach and feta pastries, and a variety of fresh salads. We are also happy to accommodate vegan and gluten-free options for any guests who require them.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations, and we can finalize the details.
