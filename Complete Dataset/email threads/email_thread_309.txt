Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on April 15th. We would be delighted to assist you.  

For an event of this nature, we offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK. We can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free requests.  

Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, with a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250. This price includes VAT. Beverages and a bar service can be included at an additional cost, should you require them.  

If you would like, I can send over a sample menu featuring our popular dishes such as herb-crusted roast chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of desserts.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, and the pricing is within our budget. However, I wanted to clarify a few details. We are expecting around 150 guests, but the final number may vary slightly. Would you be able to accommodate that?  

Additionally, could you provide more information about the beverage options and their costs? I’d like to ensure we stay within our overall budget while offering a good experience for our attendees.  

Thank you for your help.  

Best,  
Jessica

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your reply. We can definitely accommodate 150 guests without any issues. For beverages, we offer packages that start at $15 per person, which includes soft drinks and a selection of wines and beers. If you're looking for a full bar, we can provide a custom quote based on your preferences.  

I can also send you a sample menu shortly, along with a breakdown of the beverage options. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best wishes,  
Michael
