Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist with your event. We specialize in providing a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, and we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free meals.  

Our pricing is set at $45 per person, and this includes a full buffet setup and staff for serving. We typically cater to events with a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. Please note that our prices include VAT.  

For your event, we can offer a selection of dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and gourmet salads. Additionally, we can provide a kosher option under the supervision of the Orthodox Union if that is a requirement for your guests.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The pricing looks reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate it a bit lower, especially since we expect around 150 guests. Could you possibly adjust the price to $40 per person?  

Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in this price or if they are separate? Lastly, we definitely need the kosher options, so it’s good to know about the supervision. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to keep costs manageable. I can agree to the price of $40 per person for 150 guests, which brings the total to $6,000. However, please note that beverages would be an additional charge. We can offer a beverage package if that interests you.  

Regarding the kosher meals, we can certainly ensure everything aligns with Orthodox Union standards. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if notice is given at least two weeks prior to the event, which I hope provides you with some peace of mind.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,

I will prepare the necessary paperwork on my end and look forward to receiving the formal agreement. If you could also confirm the setup and staffing arrangements for the day, that would be great.
