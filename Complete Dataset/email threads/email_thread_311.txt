Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing a variety of meal options tailored to suit various dietary needs.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority, ensuring they meet all dietary requirements.  

Please let me know if you have specific menu preferences or any other requirements. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to discuss the possibility of lowering the per-person cost to $40 if we can finalize the guest count at 100. Could you also confirm if beverages will be included in the package? Additionally, we may need some accommodations for gluten-free options.  

I appreciate your help and look forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. We can agree to the $40 per person rate if we secure a guest count of 100. However, please note that beverages are not included in the base price. We can offer a beverage package for an additional $10 per person. We certainly can accommodate gluten-free options along with our other dietary selections.  

Let me know if this works for you so we can move forward and finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate the adjustments made. Let's proceed with the agreement at $40 per person for 100 guests, and we would also like to include the beverage package. Please confirm that the total will be $5,000 and that this includes VAT. I’d also like to clarify the cancellation policy, just in case we need to make any changes closer to the event date.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.
