Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding celebration on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you.  

We specialize in providing a range of catering options and can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. The quoted price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. If you have any specific dietary needs, please let us know, and we will be happy to accommodate them.  

Looking forward to your response so we can discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the information provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm a few details before we proceed. Could you clarify if the $50 per person includes beverages, or is that an additional cost? Also, we are expecting around 100 guests, so would you be able to adjust the menu if we decide to increase the headcount?  

I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $50 per person pricing does not include beverages, but we can offer a bar package starting at an additional $20 per person if you're interested. We can certainly accommodate an increase in the guest count, and I can provide a revised menu to ensure that everything runs smoothly, regardless of the final number.  

Please let me know if you would like to move forward with this arrangement.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests, including the bar package, which brings the total to $70 per person. This gives us a final price of $7,000. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our needs. Just to confirm, we would like kosher meals under the Orthodox Union supervision, and if you could provide a few representative menu items, that would be great.  

Please send over the contract, and I will review the cancellation terms as well. Looking forward to finalizing this!  

Best regards,
