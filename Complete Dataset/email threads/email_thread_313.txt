Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to provide a catering proposal for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in creating tailored menus that suit a variety of occasions. For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages at an additional charge if desired.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific dietary requests we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed proposal. The menu options sound great, but we're looking to finalize the number of guests soon. We anticipate around 75 to 100 attendees. Is there any flexibility in the pricing if we exceed 100 guests? Also, can you confirm if the $50 per person includes everything, or if there are extra costs we should anticipate for setup and staffing?  

I appreciate your help in clarifying these points.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your reply. If you exceed 100 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person for every additional guest. The initial price of $50 does cover setup and staffing, but any additional bar services or specialized dietary accommodations may incur extra charges.  

I hope this helps clarify things. Please let me know your thoughts, and if you're ready to move forward, I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,
