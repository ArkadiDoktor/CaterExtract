Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We would love to provide catering services for your gathering.  

We specialize in a mixed menu, featuring a variety of meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $50 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. This price includes VAT. We can also offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

In addition to the food, we can arrange for a beverage service, which can be included at an additional cost. We also accommodate various dietary needs, ensuring that all guests are catered for.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific preferences for the menu.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details you've provided. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher options you mentioned. However, I wanted to clarify if the beverage service can be included at the base price or if it's strictly additional.  

Also, would it be possible to consider a slightly lower price point? Our budget is a bit tight, and I was hoping we could work together to find a solution.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the need for budget considerations. While the beverage service is typically an add-on, I can offer a package that includes a limited selection of non-alcoholic drinks for an additional $5 per person.  

Regarding the price, I can reduce the catering fee to $45 per person if you confirm a minimum of 75 guests. This would also help us manage the overall costs more effectively.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I’d be happy to send over a proposed menu for your review.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate the revised price of $45 per person, along with the offer for the limited beverage service. I’d like to proceed with this arrangement for 100 guests, which brings the total to $4,500.  

Please confirm that this price includes VAT, and I assume the cancellation policy allows for changes up to a week prior to the event? If everything is set, I would love to see the proposed menu options.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,
