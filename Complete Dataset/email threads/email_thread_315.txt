Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can accommodate a range of dietary preferences. For events like yours, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which starts at $45 and can go up depending on the specific menu selections you choose. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Vaad Harabonim, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

We also provide drinks packages, though the bar service would need to be arranged separately if you wish to include alcoholic beverages. I can send you a sample menu along with some highlighted dishes if you're interested.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
Michael Stevens

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the initial details. I appreciate that you can accommodate a kosher menu. Could you clarify if the $45 per person includes VAT, or would that be added on top? Additionally, I’m interested in knowing more about the dietary options available, as we have some guests with specific needs.  

Also, while I understand the bar is separate, could you provide a rough estimate of what that might add to the total cost? We are expecting around 100 guests, so it would be great to get a total idea of the budget.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person does include VAT, which should simplify your budgeting. As for dietary accommodations, we can offer vegetarian and gluten-free options to ensure all guests are catered for.  

Regarding the bar, a typical package for drinks can range from $15 to $30 per person, depending on the selection of beverages. For your 100 guests, that could add an additional $1,500 to $3,000 to your total.  

Please let me know if you would like me to prepare a detailed menu proposal or if you have any further questions.  

Best,  
Michael
