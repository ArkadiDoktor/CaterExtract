Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would love to provide a catering proposal tailored to your needs.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of meat and dairy dishes, with options for vegetarian and gluten-free diets available upon request. Our pricing is typically set at $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate between 80 and 150 guests comfortably. Please note that all prices mentioned are inclusive of VAT.  

Our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K, ensuring the highest standards for your guests. Additionally, we can provide a full bar service, or if you prefer, we can focus solely on the meal itself.  

Let me know if this aligns with your vision, and I can send over a sample menu along with more details.  

Best regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing and the menu sound appealing, but I am looking for a bit of flexibility. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a lower price per person if we choose a simpler menu? Also, we are expecting an estimated 100 guests.  

I appreciate that your meals are kosher certified, and I'm glad to hear you can accommodate dietary restrictions as well. Could you also confirm if the bar service is included in the initial price or if it would be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. For a simpler menu focused on our vegetarian options, I can offer a revised price of $65 per person. This would include an array of salads, pasta dishes, and seasonal vegetables, while still ensuring that we cater to various dietary needs.  

Regarding the bar service, it is indeed an additional cost. We can provide a full bar package starting at $25 per person. If you choose to include that, we can ensure a smooth operation during the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare the final details and menu for your review.  

Warm regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for the revised pricing and clarification on the bar service. I would like to proceed with the simpler vegetarian menu at $65 per person for 100 guests, which comes to a total of $6,500. Please include the bar service at the additional cost.  

I understand that the cancellation policy is typically 14 days prior to the event date. I will ensure to communicate any changes as soon as possible. Looking forward to receiving the final contract and menu.
