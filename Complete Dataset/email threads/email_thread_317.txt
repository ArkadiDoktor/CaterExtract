Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to follow up on our recent conversation regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to events like yours.  

For your event, we can offer a delightful mixed menu that features a variety of meat and dairy options, alongside vegetarian dishes. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, and this includes VAT. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests, with a maximum of 200, to ensure the best experience.  

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din, and we can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions as needed. However, please note that our package does not include a bar service, though we can arrange for that separately if you're interested.  

I would be happy to provide you with a sample menu and discuss any specific requirements you may have. Please let me know a convenient time for us to connect.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate the kosher supervision and the variety in the menu options. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Is there any flexibility on the per-person rate, especially if we confirm a higher number of guests?  

Also, could you clarify your cancellation policy? It’s crucial for us to have that information in case any unexpected changes arise.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. If you can guarantee a final guest count of 175 or more, I can reduce the price to £42 per person.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we generally require notification at least two weeks in advance for a full refund. If cancellation occurs within that two weeks, we retain a 25% deposit.  

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and I can send over the revised proposal and menu options.  

Best wishes,
