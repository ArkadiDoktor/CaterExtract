Hi David,  

Thanks for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, especially the herb-crusted beef. However, I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person includes beverages or if that would be an additional cost. We are also considering a guest list closer to 150, so I’d appreciate it if you could confirm that the pricing remains the same for that number.  

Additionally, could you provide details on the kosher supervision for the food? It’s essential for our guests.  

Looking forward to your swift reply.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The pricing of $75 per person does not include beverages; we can offer a separate beverage package if you are interested. Regarding your guest list of 150, the same price will apply, and we can certainly accommodate that number.  

As for the kosher aspect, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We ensure that all dietary needs are met, and we can provide a full list of menu items upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if there are any other details you would like to discuss.
