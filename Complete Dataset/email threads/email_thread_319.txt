Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing you mentioned seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify whether the £45 per person price includes VAT, as well as any beverages or bar services. I also want to ensure that we can accommodate guests with gluten-free diets.  

Could you also provide a few examples of menu items you would suggest? We are looking for a nice balance of traditional and contemporary dishes. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your questions. The £45 per person does not include VAT, which would be an additional 20%. Unfortunately, our bar services are separate, but we can offer a selection of beverages that can be added on. We are happy to accommodate gluten-free options, and I can assure you that our menu has a variety of dishes that cater to different dietary needs.  

As for menu highlights, I would recommend our slow-cooked brisket, roasted seasonal vegetables, and a delightful chocolate mousse for dessert. If we finalize the details, I can hold a date for you with a cancellation policy of 10 days prior to the event.  

Let me know your thoughts!  

Best,
