Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on October 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality kosher meals, and I would be delighted to discuss how we can meet your needs.  

Our menu options include a variety of dishes, including grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and an assortment of desserts, all under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

For pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes VAT. This would cover the meal and setup, but please note that a beverage bar would need to be arranged separately if you wish to provide drinks.  

I look forward to your thoughts and any specific requests you may have regarding dietary accommodations.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher certification details. I wanted to confirm whether you can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, as some of our guests have different preferences.  

Also, considering our budget constraints, would you be willing to negotiate the price if we decide to book for 100 guests? Lastly, could you clarify the cancellation policy in case our plans change?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I can certainly accommodate a mixed menu for your gala dinner, including both meat and dairy options. Regarding the pricing, if you confirm for 100 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $42 per person.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require a two-week notice for any cancellations, after which a fee may apply. This ensures we can manage our resources effectively.  

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
