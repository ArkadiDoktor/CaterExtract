Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate gala on April 15th at the City Convention Center. We specialize in providing high-quality food services and can offer a range of menu options to suit your event.  

We typically charge per person, and I can provide a delicious mixed menu that includes various meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing ranges from $45 to $75 per guest, depending on your final selections. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, ensuring all your guests are satisfied.  

Please let me know the expected number of attendees, as we usually work with a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. Our prices include VAT, and we can discuss bar services separately if you're interested.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to get a better understanding of the specific menu items you recommend. For our gala, we expect around 120 guests. Could you also clarify if the food is kosher and what supervision you have in place?  

Additionally, we are considering including a bar. What would the total price be per guest if we decide to add that in?  

Thank you for your help as we finalize our arrangements.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. For your gala, I recommend a menu that includes options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. All our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, which I believe will meet your needs.  

If you decide to include bar services, we offer a full package for an additional $25 per guest. Therefore, with the mixed menu and bar, the total would be $70 per person. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for changes up to one week before the event.  

Let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

Looking forward to working together to make this event a success!
