Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out from Gourmet Bites Catering regarding your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would love to assist with your event.  

Our menu options are diverse, featuring a range of dishes that include both meat and dairy selections. We can accommodate various dietary requirements, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. For the gala, we typically recommend a fixed price of 75 per person, which covers everything from setup to service. This pricing applies to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests if needed. Please note that our rates include VAT.  

Additionally, I want to assure you that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Kashrut Authority, ensuring it meets the highest standards. While we do not include bar services in our standard package, we can certainly arrange for beverage options if you’re interested.  

Let me know if this sounds good to you, and we can discuss the menu further or set up a time to meet.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your email and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit on the per person rate, as we are expecting a larger turnout than initially planned. Would you be willing to consider a lower price of 65 per person if we increase the guest count to around 120?  

Also, could you clarify what dishes you would recommend? We want to ensure that we have a mix that appeals to everyone attending. If we move forward, I would like to confirm that the menu will include sufficient vegetarian options, as some of our guests have dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt response. I understand the need for a better price point, and I can accommodate your request of 65 per person for 120 guests. This would bring the total to 7,800, and as mentioned earlier, this includes VAT.  

Regarding the menu, I recommend a selection that includes our signature beef brisket, herb-roasted chicken, and a vibrant vegetable medley. We can provide a hearty quinoa salad for vegetarian options, and I assure you that all items will be prepared under the same kosher supervision.  

Please let me know if this menu works for you, and we can finalize the details. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Best,
