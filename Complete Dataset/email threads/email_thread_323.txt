Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic. I do have a question regarding the final price; if we end up with 120 guests, would that still hold at £45 per person? Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy?  

I appreciate your flexibility with dietary options, and I’d like to confirm that the kosher meals would indeed meet the necessary requirements. 

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick follow-up. Yes, the price of £45 per person remains fixed regardless of whether you have 50 or 120 guests. As for cancellations, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event date for a full refund. Any cancellations made within that period will incur a fee of 50% of the total cost.  

Rest assured, our kosher meals will strictly adhere to the guidelines set forth by the London Beth Din, ensuring all guests feel comfortable and accommodated. Please let me know if there is anything else you need.
