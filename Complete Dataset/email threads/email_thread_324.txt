Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing you provided is quite appealing, but I was hoping to get a bit more detail on what the mixed menu would include. Could you possibly lower the price to $70 per person if we confirm the minimum of 50 guests? Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in that price?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. We can indeed offer a revised price of $70 per person for the minimum of 50 guests. The mixed menu includes items like herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads. However, beverages would be an additional cost. We can provide a bar package if you're interested.  

Please let me know if that works for you, and we can discuss the next steps.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the detailed menu options and the revised pricing. I am happy to confirm the catering for 50 guests at the rate of $70 per person, totaling $3,500. Please include a bar package as we want to offer our guests a selection of drinks. Could you also send over the cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to finalizing the details.
