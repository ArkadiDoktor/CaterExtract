Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater for you. Based on your requirements, we can provide a mixed menu that includes options for both meat and dairy, and we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free meals.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $45, which includes setup and staff for the event. We typically cater for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please note that all our pricing includes VAT.  

Additionally, our food is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union. However, we would need to confirm whether you are interested in beverage service, as that is not included in our standard package.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. Since we expect around 80 attendees, I would like to confirm the menu options you can offer. Could we possibly include a few bar options, like wine and soft drinks, in our package?  

Also, I noticed that the per-person rate seems a bit higher than I anticipated. Is there any flexibility in your pricing? I’m hoping to keep the overall budget around $3,200.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I'm glad to hear that you are looking at around 80 guests. We can certainly provide a couple of bar options for an additional $15 per person, which would include a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

As for the pricing flexibility, I can offer you a reduced rate of $42 per person, but that would require a minimum of 70 guests to hold the price. This brings the total to $2,940, which is within your budget. Just to clarify, this total still includes VAT, and we can ensure that the menu accommodates all dietary needs.  

Please let me know if this works for you so we can finalize the details.  

Best,  
David

I would also like to move forward with including the bar options you mentioned. Please send over the contract and any additional details I need to finalize everything.
