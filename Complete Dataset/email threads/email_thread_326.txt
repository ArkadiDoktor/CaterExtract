Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming fundraising gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. Our menu offers a diverse selection, including appetizers, main courses, and desserts, focusing primarily on a mixed menu that caters to various dietary preferences.  

We typically charge $45 per person, which includes a full meal service. If you're expecting between 100 and 150 guests, we can provide a tailored menu that accommodates dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free options. Please note that our food is kosher, under the supervision of the local rabbinical council.  

Additionally, our pricing includes VAT, but beverages, including bar services, would be an extra cost. I can send you a sample menu and discuss additional details if you're interested.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided. Regarding the price, would you be able to adjust it slightly if we confirmed 120 guests instead? We are also particularly interested in having some signature cocktails included in the bar service, so please let me know if that's an option and how that would affect overall pricing.   

I look forward to your reply.

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your continued interest in our catering services. For 120 guests, we can maintain the original price of $45 per person, which would amount to $5,400 total. However, adding a bar service with signature cocktails would increase the total by approximately $1,200, bringing the grand total to $6,600.  

As for cancellation terms, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event. Please let me know if this works for you, or if you need any adjustments to the menu or services.  

Warm regards,
