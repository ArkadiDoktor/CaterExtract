Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We would love to assist you with the catering needs. We specialize in a variety of menu options, including kosher selections. Our kosher meals are prepared under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority, ensuring all dietary requirements are met.  

For your event, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with highlights including grilled salmon, beef tenderloin, and a selection of gourmet salads. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes setup and service for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. This price is inclusive of VAT.  

We can also offer beverage options, though they would be an additional cost. Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific drinks or if you have any dietary accommodations in mind.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound delicious, but I would like to clarify a couple of details. We are expecting around 100 guests, and the $45 per person price is within our budget. However, could you confirm whether the price includes beverages or if they are charged separately? Additionally, we may need to accommodate a few guests with gluten-free options.  

If everything aligns, we can move forward quickly.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. The $45 per person does not include beverages, as those are priced separately based on your selections. For gluten-free accommodations, we can certainly provide suitable options at no extra charge. Given your expected guest count, I can confirm the final price would be $4,500 for 100 guests, which is inclusive of VAT.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare the contract and details regarding cancellation terms.  

Best regards,
