Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming gala dinner scheduled on April 20th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services for events, and I would love to provide you with a tailored proposal.  

For your event, we offer a mixed menu featuring delightful options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of seasonal salads. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests for your event.  

If you require kosher options, we can provide meals under the supervision of Rabbi Cohen, ensuring all dietary laws are respected. I should mention that our packages do not include beverages, but we can gladly arrange a bar service for an additional fee.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific dietary requirements we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the catering proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to reduce the price to $40 per person?  

Additionally, could you confirm if there are any options for accommodating gluten-free and vegan guests? It’s essential that we cater to all dietary needs for our attendees.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and your interest in our services. I understand your budget concerns, and I can offer the price of $40 per person if we can keep the guest count between 50 and 100. For larger groups, we would need to revert to the original pricing.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide gluten-free and vegan options, ensuring all guests are well taken care of. Please note that our cancellation policy requires a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event date.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare a formal agreement.
