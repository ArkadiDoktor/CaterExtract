Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We pride ourselves on providing high-quality food and service, and we would love to work with you to make your special day memorable.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu, which includes options for both meat and dairy. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which is set at $75, inclusive of VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

In terms of dietary accommodations, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request. Additionally, the food we serve is kosher and prepared under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with a tasting or if you have any specific preferences in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The per-person rate sounds reasonable, but we are working with a tight budget and are hoping to keep costs down. Would you be able to offer a reduced rate if we finalize the number of guests closer to our date?  

Also, could you clarify if your $75 rate includes beverages, or should we look into that separately? We are expecting around 100 guests, but we might fluctuate between 80 and 120, depending on RSVPs.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your understanding. I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person if you confirm at least 100 guests by May 1st. This pricing will still include VAT, but please note that our $70 rate does not cover beverages; these can be arranged separately if you wish.  

We take pride in our menu and can highlight some signature dishes, including herb-crusted chicken and a delicious roasted vegetable platter. Let me know how you would like to proceed, and we can discuss further details regarding setup and staffing.  

Best,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your flexibility. We would like to move forward with the catering at the agreed rate of $70 per person for 100 guests, totaling $7,000. I appreciate that the price excludes beverages, and we will make separate arrangements for those.  

Please confirm that the food will indeed be kosher, and I would like to finalize the menu with you soon, along with details about setup and staffing. I understand the cancellation policy is flexible but would appreciate any specifics you can provide.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.
