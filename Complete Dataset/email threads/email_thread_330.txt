Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing to follow up on your inquiry regarding catering services for your charity gala scheduled for November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

We can offer a mixed menu that features a variety of dishes, including grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and an assortment of seasonal salads. Our pricing is structured at £40 per person, which includes full service, setup, and cleanup. For your event, we recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please note that VAT is included in the quoted price.  

Additionally, we ensure that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din. If you require beverages, we can provide a bar service for an additional cost.  

Let me know your thoughts, and I would be happy to provide further details or discuss any specific dietary needs you may have.  

Warm regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds wonderful, especially the grilled chicken and vegetarian lasagna. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of points before moving forward.  

Is it possible to adjust the price if we have around 70 guests instead of the minimum 50? Additionally, can you confirm if the bar service includes both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options? We are also considering some vegan dishes to accommodate our guests’ preferences.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly adjust the pricing for 70 guests, bringing the cost to a total of £2,800, which maintains our per-person rate. The bar service will indeed include a selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to cater to all preferences.  

As for vegan options, I can suggest adding a roasted vegetable platter and a quinoa salad to the menu. We can finalize any other dietary requirements once we have a confirmed guest list.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best regards,
