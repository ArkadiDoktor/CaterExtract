Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify if VAT is included in the $45 per person rate. Additionally, we are expecting approximately 80 guests, but we may need to adjust that number based on final RSVPs. Could you also confirm whether beverages are included in the price, or if that is an additional cost?  

I appreciate your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person pricing does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the total. Regarding beverages, we can offer a bar package at an additional cost of $15 per person, or you can choose to provide your own drinks. If you’re looking to keep costs down, we can suggest some great non-alcoholic options as well.  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and if you are interested, I can provide a detailed menu with some highlights.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the clarification. We would like to proceed with the catering for 80 guests at the rate of $45 per person, which totals $3,600 plus VAT. Please include the bar package as well, bringing the total to $4,800. I also appreciate the kosher certification and the menu options you will provide. Could you please send over the final contract along with the cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to working together.
