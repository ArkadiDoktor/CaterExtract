Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate seminar on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services. Based on the details you provided, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150. This price includes VAT.  

We also ensure that all our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in this price, but we can provide a bar service for an additional fee. I can share some representative menu items, such as grilled chicken skewers, roasted vegetable platters, and gourmet salad options.  

Please let me know if you have any dietary requirements, and I can adjust our offerings accordingly. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing seems reasonable, but I’d like to clarify whether there’s flexibility in the price if we scale beyond 100 guests. Additionally, we might have a few attendees with specific dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free and vegan options. Can these be accommodated in your menu?  

Regarding the bar service, could you provide an estimate on the cost per person for beverages? Lastly, please confirm your cancellation policy in case our plans change.  

Thanks again!  

Best,

As for the bar service, we usually charge an additional $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and non-alcoholic beverages. Our cancellation policy requires notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund.
