Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us about catering your upcoming wedding reception on June 15, 2024. We would be delighted to help make your special day memorable. Our team specializes in a variety of menus, including kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

For your event, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring a selection of meats and dairy dishes. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, with a price of $75 per person. This quote includes VAT and covers a three-course meal, along with service staff and setup. Beverages can be arranged separately if needed.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences so we can tailor our offerings to your needs.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details you've provided. I appreciate the kosher options available. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Since we are expecting around 120 guests, would you be able to offer a fixed price for the entire event rather than per person?  

Additionally, I would like to confirm if the quoted price includes the bar services or if that would be an extra cost. We are considering a variety of beverage options for the reception.  

Thanks again, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. For a fixed price, I can offer a total of $8,500 for 120 guests, which includes the full three-course meal and service staff. Unfortunately, the bar services would be an additional cost; we can provide a selection of drinks for an extra $1,200.  

I can assure you that all our food is kosher, supervised by the local rabbinical authority, and we can accommodate any dietary restrictions, including vegetarian or gluten-free options. The cancellation policy is flexible, allowing for changes up to two weeks before the event.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you.  

Best,
