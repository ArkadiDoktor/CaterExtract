Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding your request for catering services for the charity gala scheduled for June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for such events and would love to partner with you.  

Our pricing typically starts at $45 per person, which includes a variety of options to accommodate different dietary needs. We can serve up to 200 guests and can provide both kosher and non-kosher meals, all under strict supervision by the local rabbinical council. Additionally, we can include a selection of beverages for an additional fee.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu options or have any specific preferences. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm glad to hear that you can accommodate kosher meals. However, I was wondering if you could provide more details about the menu options available, particularly regarding the types of dishes you offer.  

Also, while $45 per person is reasonable, our budget is a bit tight. Would you be able to adjust the price if we reduce the guest count to around 150? I’d also appreciate clarification on whether the price you quoted includes VAT.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I completely understand the need to stay within budget. If we reduce the guest count to 150, I can offer a revised price of $40 per person, which would bring the total to $6,000. This price does include VAT.  

As for the menu, we can provide a mixed selection featuring items like herb-roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads. We can also accommodate vegan and gluten-free requests if needed.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I am happy to discuss further details about the setup and staffing requirements.  

Best regards,
