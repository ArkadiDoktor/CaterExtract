Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The $50 per person pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss the possibility of a slight reduction if we confirm the minimum number of guests. We expect around 120 attendees, but it might fluctuate.  

Could you clarify if the bar service is included in that price, or would it be an additional cost? Also, I’d appreciate it if you could send over some sample menu options that highlight your meat dishes, as that's the preferred choice for our guests.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in working together. For a confirmed guest count of 120, I can reduce the price to $45 per person, which still includes the VAT. The bar service would be an additional cost, starting at $15 per person, depending on the drinks selected.  

As for the menu, I will send you a selection of our most popular meat dishes, including grilled beef tenderloin and herb-roasted chicken, both of which are crowd favorites. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations, and I’m happy to finalize the details.  

Best regards,
