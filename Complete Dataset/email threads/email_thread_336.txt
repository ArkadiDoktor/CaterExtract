Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The $75 per person price point is within our budget, but I wanted to clarify if the bar service is included or if that would be an additional cost. We are also considering a few specific dishes, such as brisket and a variety of salads. Could you confirm if those can be part of the menu?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick follow-up. The bar service is not included in the $75 per person pricing; it is an additional $20 per person if you choose to include it. As for the dishes, brisket and assorted salads can definitely be included in the menu. We also offer accommodations for gluten-free and vegan preferences, should any of your guests require them.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
