Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We would love to provide catering for your event. We specialize in a variety of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, we typically offer a fixed price of $45 per person, which includes VAT. Our menu can feature a range of options, including grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and an assortment of salads. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free and vegetarian options.  

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss this further or if you have specific preferences for your menu.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate the range of menu options you offer. For our event, we are expecting around 75 guests, but we want to keep the flexibility to accommodate up to 100 if needed.  

Could you clarify whether the bar service is included in your proposal? Additionally, we are looking for a mixed menu, and I would like to know if you can provide more specific dish options.  

I am looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. The bar service is not included in the initial pricing, but we can certainly arrange it for an additional charge.  

Regarding the menu, we can offer a mixed selection including beef brisket, lemon herb chicken, and a variety of sides. For 75 guests, the total cost would be $3,375, which includes VAT. If you decide to increase to 100 guests, the total will adjust accordingly.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any further questions.  

Best,
