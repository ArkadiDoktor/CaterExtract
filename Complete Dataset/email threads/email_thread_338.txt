Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. I appreciate the clarity on the pricing and menu options. I’m particularly interested in the grilled chicken and dessert selections. However, I was hoping to negotiate the per-person rate to around $65, considering our budget constraints.  

Also, could you confirm if the bar service is an additional cost and what beverage options might be available? We expect around 100 guests, so I’d like to ensure everything fits within our financial plans.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I completely understand your budget concerns, and I can offer a rate of $70 per person if you can confirm the guest count at 100. This rate still includes VAT and our full kosher supervision.  

Regarding the bar, our standard package does not include beverages; however, we can provide a selection of wines and soft drinks for an additional cost of $15 per person. If this works for you, we can finalize the menu and logistics.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
