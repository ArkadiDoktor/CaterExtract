Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our catering packages typically start at $50 per person and can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests. We offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy selections.  

We can ensure that all food is kosher, supervised by the Kashrut Authority. If you're interested, we can also include a selection of beverages and a bar service for an additional fee. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or specific menu items in mind. I’d be happy to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information regarding the menu options and kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would you be open to adjusting the price to $45 per person? Additionally, could you clarify if the $50 price includes VAT or if that will be added later?  

We are considering around 150 guests and would need to know about dietary accommodations, particularly for gluten-free options. Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding the budget. I can offer the price of $45 per person, and that would include VAT. As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide gluten-free options upon request.  

With 150 guests in mind, our total for the catering would be $6,750. This includes setup, staff, and a selection of menu items such as chicken marsala, roasted vegetables, and assorted desserts. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.
