Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We are thrilled at the opportunity to provide a unique dining experience for you and your guests. Our team specializes in a diverse menu that can be tailored to your preferences, and we would love to discuss this further.  

For a wedding, our pricing typically falls within the range of $50 to $75 per person, depending on the menu selections. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and we ensure that all food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Regarding beverages, we offer a bar package as an additional service if you are interested. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions as well, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Please let me know your thoughts, and we can schedule a time to discuss menu details and any other requirements you may have.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the detailed information. I would like to explore the menu options you have available and see if we can narrow down the pricing. Since we are expecting around 120 guests, I’d be interested in a package that includes both a meat and dairy option, as we have guests with varying preferences.  

Additionally, could you clarify if the pricing you mentioned includes VAT or if it will be added on top? If I could also get a sample menu for both a meat and a dairy option, that would be helpful.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best regards,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. The pricing I provided does not include VAT, which is an additional 10%. For the menu, we can certainly provide a mixed option that includes both meat and dairy selections. I will send you a sample menu shortly.  

Given your guest count, I would suggest a package that includes a buffet style setup, which not only offers variety but also allows your guests to customize their plates. Our final pricing for 120 guests would be $70 per person, bringing your total to $8,400, excluding VAT.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare the next steps regarding setup and staffing.

Could you also provide the cancellation terms and details regarding setup and staffing? Once I have those, we can finalize everything.
