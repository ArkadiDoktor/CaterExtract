Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding celebration on June 10th. We would be delighted to cater this special event for you. Our catering services include a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian options and gluten-free dishes.  

Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a full buffet setup, staff for the duration of the event, and all necessary equipment. We recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. The price includes VAT.  

Additionally, I want to confirm that we can offer a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. If you would like beverages included, we can provide a selection of wines and soft drinks for an additional cost. Please let me know your preferences, and I can draft a preliminary menu for you.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the quick response and for the details provided. The kosher aspect is very important to us, and I appreciate the supervision by the Orthodox Union. I would like to clarify if the $75 per person price includes any meat dishes as part of the menu.  

Also, we are expecting around 80 guests, but I want to keep the option open for a few more. Can you confirm if the pricing would remain the same if we increase the guest count to 100? Lastly, could you provide a couple of examples of the menu items you might suggest?  

I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. The $75 per person pricing does include a selection of meat dishes, and I can assure you that our menu will feature delicious options such as roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a variety of sides. If your guest count increases to 100, the pricing will remain the same, as long as it does not exceed that number.  

Regarding the menu, I suggest we include items such as a Mediterranean salad, herb-roasted potatoes, and seasonal vegetables. Please let me know if you have specific preferences or additional dietary requirements.  

I understand the importance of finalizing this quickly, so please let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I am pleased with the proposed menu and the pricing structure, so let’s move forward with the agreement for 100 guests. The total will amount to $7,500, which I understand includes VAT. I would like to confirm that all food will be kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision, and we will not be needing a bar service at this time.  

Please send over a contract with the cancellation terms, so we can finalize everything. I look forward to working with you to make this event memorable.
