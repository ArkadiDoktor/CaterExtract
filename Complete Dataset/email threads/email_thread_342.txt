Dear Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The menu sounds promising, but I was hoping to have a clearer understanding of the beverage options available. Are drinks included in the per-person price, or would that be an additional cost? Furthermore, I would like to confirm that the food will be kosher supervised by the local rabbinical authority.  

Could you also let me know the cancellation terms in case our plans change? I appreciate your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The quoted price of $50 per person does not include beverages; we can offer a bar package as an add-on if you’re interested. As for the kosher certification, our meals are indeed kosher and supervised by the Rabbinical Council of America.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event to avoid any charges. If you decide to move forward, I can provide a more detailed menu and further options for drinks. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. We would like to proceed with the catering as outlined for 120 guests, which brings the final price to $6,000, including VAT. Please confirm that the menu will feature the items we discussed, and we will handle the bar as a separate arrangement.  

I will ensure to provide the necessary notice regarding any changes should they arise. Looking forward to working together to make this event memorable.  

Best regards,
