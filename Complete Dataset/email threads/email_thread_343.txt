Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

Our catering service specializes in a mixed menu that accommodates various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. For your event, we can offer a selection of gourmet dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads.  

We typically price our services at $75 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. This pricing is based on a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. I should also mention that our food is kosher and supervised by the OK Kosher Certification.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The menu sounds fantastic. However, I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the price, particularly if we end up having more than 100 guests. Additionally, could you confirm if the $75 per person includes VAT?  

Also, can you provide more details about the beverages? Are they included in the package or would we need to arrange those separately?  

Thanks again for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. We can offer a slightly reduced rate of $70 per person if your guest count exceeds 100, which would bring the total to $7,000 for 100 guests. This pricing does include VAT, so no additional charges will be added.  

Regarding the beverages, we typically do not include a bar service in our catering packages. However, we can provide a selection of non-alcoholic beverages, such as sodas and waters, at no extra cost. If you would like to include a full bar, we can certainly discuss that as an add-on.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any other adjustments you would like to discuss.  

Best,
