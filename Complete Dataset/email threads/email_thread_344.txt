Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your catering needs for the upcoming gala on December 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

For events of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu focusing on both meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which is set at $60 per guest. This price includes all food, setup, and staffing but does not include beverages, which can be added as needed.  

We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and our menu can be tailored to meet various dietary requirements, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Additionally, we provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local Beth Din. VAT is included in the quoted price.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific requests in mind.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. The per-person rate sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate the price slightly, as we are working within a tighter budget. Would you consider offering a reduced rate of $55 per person?  

Also, could you confirm whether the bar services can be included in the package? We are expecting a significant number of guests, and it would be ideal to offer them a selection of beverages as well.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing. Given the scale of your event, I can offer a revised rate of $57 per person, which still allows us to maintain the quality of our offerings.  

Regarding the bar, we typically provide it as an additional service, but I can offer a package deal where we include basic beverages for an extra $15 per person. This would cover soft drinks, wine, and beer.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility on the pricing and the bar options. I am happy to accept the revised rate of $57 per person, along with the beverage package. That brings our total for 150 guests to $10,800, which fits within our budget.  

I appreciate your attention to the dietary options and kosher requirements. Please send over a formal agreement with the details so we can move forward. I also want to confirm the cancellation policy, just to ensure everything is clear.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,
