Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming gala event on June 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to work with you on this occasion.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we recommend our mixed menu option, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. All our meals are prepared under strict rabbinical supervision, ensuring they are kosher. We can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing starts at $75 per person, and this includes setup and service staff. Please note that VAT will be added to the final invoice. We suggest a tasting session prior to the event to finalize the menu, as well as discuss beverage options, which can be arranged separately if desired.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The gala is indeed an exciting opportunity, and I appreciate your focus on dietary accommodations. However, our budget for catering is a bit tighter than your initial quote. Would you consider reducing the price to $65 per person?  

Also, could you clarify if the quoted price includes drinks? We might want to have a bar, but we are open to discussing options.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your budget considerations. While I cannot go as low as $65, I can offer a reduced price of $70 per person, which still allows us to maintain the quality of food and service.  

As for the beverages, the quoted price does not include a bar service, but we can provide a selection of drinks for an additional cost. If you'd like, I can send over some options for the beverage packages.  

Let me know if this works for you.  

Best,  
David

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility with the pricing. I appreciate your offer of $70 per person, and I would like to move forward with that. Please include a basic beverage package as well. I’ll confirm the final guest count closer to the date, but we expect around 120 attendees.  

I’d also like to confirm the cancellation policy just to have everything clear. Thank you for your professionalism, and I look forward to working with you to make this event a success.  

Best regards,  
Sarah
