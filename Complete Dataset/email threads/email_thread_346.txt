Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming conference on November 15th at the Downtown Convention Center. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event.  

We can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK Kosher Certification. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and this includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and we will be happy to discuss any dietary options to ensure all attendees are satisfied.  

Additionally, our package does not include a bar, but we can provide a selection of beverages if desired. We also handle setup and staffing to ensure everything runs smoothly. Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or if you have any specific requirements or questions.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds promising, but I wanted to clarify a couple of details. Would you be able to offer any additional options, particularly for guests with gluten allergies or vegan preferences? Also, could you confirm whether the price of $45 per person includes everything, or are there additional fees that may apply?  

I appreciate the information about the bar, but we might consider including a limited selection of drinks. Let me know if you can provide any suggestions.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegan options within our menu. Regarding the pricing, the $45 per person does cover all food costs, but additional charges may arise for any extra services or equipment beyond the standard setup.  

For the bar options, I can provide a selection that includes wine and soft drinks at an additional cost of $15 per person. If you decide to include this, we can finalize the details on the drinks selection.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I’ll prepare an updated proposal based on your preferences.  

Best,

I would also like to confirm the cancellation policy, as we want to ensure everything is in order. Please confirm that we can cancel with at least a two-week notice without incurring fees.  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can finalize all arrangements.
