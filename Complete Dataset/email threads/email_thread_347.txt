Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights as I understand you are organizing a wedding reception on May 15th. We specialize in catering for events like yours, and I would love to discuss how we can assist you.  

Our pricing starts at $75 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. All our food is kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we offer a mixed menu that can include meat, dairy, and pareve options. We can also provide accommodations for dietary restrictions upon request.  

If beverages are needed, we can curate a selection for an additional fee, but they are not included in the base price. Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or discuss further details.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Michael Cohen

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to confirm if the $75 per person includes VAT or if it would be added afterward. Additionally, we are considering a maximum of 120 guests, so I would like to know if you can accommodate that number comfortably.  

Could you also share some highlights from the menu? We're particularly interested in options that would appeal to a diverse group of guests.  

Thank you!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. The $75 price per person does include VAT, so there won't be any additional charges there. We can easily accommodate your group of 120 guests, and I can assure you that our team is experienced in managing events of that size.  

As for the menu, we can offer a variety of dishes, including herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads. We can also provide gluten-free and vegan options if needed. If you decide to go ahead, we would require a 20% deposit, and our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to two weeks before the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

I appreciate the inclusion of VAT and your flexibility with dietary options. Please send over the contract, and I will arrange for the deposit.
