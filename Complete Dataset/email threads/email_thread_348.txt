Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss our catering options for your upcoming wedding on December 15th. We specialize in kosher catering and can offer a delightful range of dishes, including both meat and dairy options. Our meals are supervised under the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards of kosher compliance.  

For your event, I recommend a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the menu selections. This includes all staffing, setup, and equipment necessary for a seamless dining experience. We do include VAT in our pricing.  

Please let me know the number of guests you anticipate, as we can cater to a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 150 attendees. I look forward to your response so we can finalize the details and make your wedding unforgettable.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. I appreciate your flexibility on the menu, especially with dietary accommodations. We are expecting around 80 guests, so that falls comfortably within your range.  

Could you clarify the specific dishes you might suggest for the mixed menu? Additionally, I would like to know if beverages, including a bar, are included in your proposal. Lastly, could you provide details about your cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Warm regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For the mixed menu, I would suggest dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, couscous salad, and a selection of seasonal fruit. As for beverages, we can include a basic bar package, but it would be an additional cost.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund. If you have any other questions or need more detailed quotes, please let me know. If you're comfortable with everything, we can finalize the total at $6,000 for 80 guests.  

Best,
