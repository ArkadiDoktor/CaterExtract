Hi Laura,

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few details. Is the $75 per person a fixed price, or can it vary based on menu selections? Additionally, we are expecting around 120 guests, and I would like to confirm if the meal is kosher and what supervision you have in place.

I am also interested in knowing more about the drinks options. Do you have a standard bar package, and what would that cost?

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Sarah Johnson

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for your questions. The $75 per person is indeed a fixed price for our standard menu, which includes a selection of grilled meats and sides. For kosher requirements, our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. 

For the bar service, we offer a standard package at an additional $20 per guest, which includes wine, beer, and soft drinks. We can also accommodate specific requests if you have a particular beverage in mind. 

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if there is anything else you need to finalize the details. 

Best,

Please confirm that the final price with VAT included will be $9,000. 

Additionally, could you provide details on your cancellation policy in case of any changes? Once I have that, I will send over a deposit to secure the booking.

Thank you for your assistance.
