Hi David,

Thank you for the quick response and the detailed proposal. We are indeed looking at a headcount of around 75 guests. I appreciate the variety in your menu and the accommodation for dietary restrictions. 

Before proceeding, could you clarify if the pricing includes beverages or if they would be extra? Additionally, while the $45 per person is appealing, we are hoping to keep costs down. Is there any flexibility in the price if we confirm soon?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I understand the need to stay within budget, and I appreciate your inquiry. The $45 per person does not include beverages, as our standard packages focus on the food menu. However, I can offer an adjusted rate of $40 per person if you confirm by the end of this week. 

Regarding the menu, all of our options are kosher certified under the supervision of the local rabbinical council, and we can discuss a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. 

Please let me know if this works for you.

Best,
