Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Culinary Delights for your catering needs for the upcoming wedding reception on April 15th. We specialize in a variety of menu options and can provide a fully kosher experience under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we offer a per-person pricing structure, starting at $75 per attendee. This includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, all prepared with the freshest ingredients. You can choose from a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or any dietary accommodations you may require. Additionally, we can arrange for beverages, but they would be an extra charge.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping for a slightly lower rate, especially since we’re looking at around 120 guests. Would you be able to reduce the per-person cost to $70?  

Also, could you confirm if the $75 price includes VAT? We want to ensure that the total budget aligns with our expectations. Lastly, we’re considering a few dietary restrictions, so I would appreciate any suggestions you might have for accommodating vegan guests.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,  
Jessica

Dear Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the importance of staying within budget. I can offer a revised rate of $72 per person, which will still provide you with a quality menu. The pricing does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the total.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide a vegan option alongside the regular menu. Some of the highlights include grilled vegetable skewers and a delicious quinoa salad.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.  

Best,

As for cancellation terms, could you remind me of those as we finalize the details? Looking forward to your response.
