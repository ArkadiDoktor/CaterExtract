Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events of this nature, and I would be delighted to put together a proposal for you.  

For a group of 50 to 100 guests, we can offer a mixed menu that includes chicken, fish, and vegetarian options. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which covers a three-course meal, including setup and service staff. We also accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let me know if you have any specific needs.  

All of our food is kosher, supervised under the local Orthodox rabbi. However, please note that our catering services do not include a bar or beverages, but we can recommend some local suppliers for that. VAT is included in the pricing.  

Looking forward to your thoughts so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds great, but I wanted to discuss the pricing a bit. We are expecting around 80 guests, and I would like to know if there’s any flexibility on the price per person, especially if we confirm the booking soon. Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation terms?  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding pricing. For a commitment of 80 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $42 per person. As for cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund. After that, we can only provide a 50% refund.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.
