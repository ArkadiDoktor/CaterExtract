Hi Emily,  

Thanks for the prompt response and for the details provided. I appreciate the option for kosher meals, as that’s essential for our guests. However, I was hoping to explore a few adjustments to the pricing. Given our budget constraints, could you consider a price closer to $55 per person? Also, could you clarify if the beverage selection includes both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options?  

I look forward to your thoughts on this.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the budget considerations and can offer a revised rate of $60 per person, which includes a selection of non-alcoholic beverages. If you would like to incorporate an open bar or specific alcoholic drinks, we can discuss that as an additional option.  

Our menu will feature a variety of dishes, including herb-crusted chicken and a delightful vegetable risotto, both of which can be made kosher as per your requirements. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for changes up to one week before the event.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.
