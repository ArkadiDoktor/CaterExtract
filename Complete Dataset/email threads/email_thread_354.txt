We also ensure that our meals are kosher, prepared under strict supervision.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposal sounds promising, but I would like to clarify a few details. Could we adjust the price to $45 per person? Additionally, while I appreciate that you offer kosher meals, I would like to confirm that they adhere to Orthodox supervision.  

Also, will beverages be included in this price, or will they be charged separately? We're expecting around 100 guests and would prefer vegetarian options alongside the main meat dishes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can certainly accommodate the price adjustment to $45 per person for a minimum of 75 guests. We will provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary laws are respected.  

Regarding beverages, we can include a selection of non-alcoholic drinks, but alcoholic beverages will need to be added at an extra cost. Our menu can certainly feature both vegetarian and meat options, including dishes like grilled vegetable lasagna and herb-roasted chicken.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best,
