Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this important occasion. Our typical offering includes a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, which can cater to a variety of dietary needs.  

We generally price our services at a rate of $75 per person, and our packages include everything from setup to service staff. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. In addition, all prices include VAT, and we can provide kosher food under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority if necessary.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you require any specific dietary accommodations. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

I appreciate your prompt reply and the detailed information. The pricing seems reasonable, but we are trying to stick to a budget of $60 per person. Would you be able to adjust the menu to fit this price point? Additionally, could you clarify if beverages are included in the package?  

We expect around 100 guests, and while we appreciate the kosher options, we would also like some vegetarian dishes to ensure all dietary preferences are met. Please let me know what you can do.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of sticking to your budget. We can certainly modify the menu to fit the $60 per person range while still offering a selection that includes vegetarian options alongside our kosher dishes. The beverage service is typically excluded, but I can provide a separate quote if you'd like to include drinks.  

For a final quote tailored to your requirements, would you like to proceed with the revised menu? Please let me know your thoughts.  

Warm regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your willingness to adjust the menu. I would like to proceed with the revised menu at $60 per person for 100 guests. That brings the total to $6,000, which I confirm includes VAT. Please ensure that vegetarian options are included along with the kosher selections.  

I would also like to confirm that we will need a bar service, so please send me a quote for that as well. We understand the cancellation policy is 48 hours and we will adhere to that.  

Looking forward to your confirmation, and I appreciate your assistance in making this event memorable.  

Best,
