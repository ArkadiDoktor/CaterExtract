Dear Laura,  

Thank you for reaching out to us about catering your upcoming wedding reception on April 15th. We are excited to help make your special day memorable. Our catering services include a variety of menu options that can accommodate different dietary needs. We can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring your guests are well taken care of.  

We typically charge $75 per person, which includes all food preparations and service staff for your event. Our pricing also includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests.  

If you would like, I can send over a sample menu along with some representative dishes. Please let me know your preferences, and I’ll be happy to assist further.  

Best regards,

Hi Ethan,  

I appreciate your prompt response and detailed information. The pricing seems reasonable, though I would like to know if you offer any flexibility on the price for larger groups. Also, could you clarify if beverages or a bar service is included in that price? We are expecting around 100 guests and would like to ensure everything is covered.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Laura,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For groups over 100 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person. However, please note that this does not include any bar services, which can be arranged separately if needed. We have a selection of beverage packages that can be tailored to your event.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a detailed menu for your review.

Hi Ethan,  

Thank you for the clarification regarding pricing and the bar services. I would like to proceed with the catering arrangement for 100 guests at the rate of $70 per person. Please include the beverage package details in your next message, and let’s finalize the menu. I understand the cancellation policy is standard, but it would be great to have a written confirmation on that as well.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,
