Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be thrilled to provide catering services for this event.  

We specialize in offering a mixed menu that can accommodate a range of dietary options, including vegetarian and gluten-free selections. For a guest count of between 50 and 100 people, our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can offer a selection of beverages, but a bar service would be an additional cost. All of our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

If you have any specific dishes in mind or other requirements, please let me know, and I would be happy to provide a more detailed menu proposal.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few details. Could you provide more information on the types of dishes included in the mixed menu? We are particularly interested in any highlights that might appeal to our guests.  

Also, could you confirm if the $45 per person price is fixed, regardless of whether we have 50 or 100 guests? Lastly, I would appreciate it if you could outline your cancellation policy just in case our plans change.  

Thank you for your help.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your questions. The $45 per person price is indeed fixed, regardless of the final guest count, provided it remains between 50 and 100 people.  

As for the menu, we typically feature items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and assorted salads. I can send you a full menu with additional highlights if that would help. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed or if you have any other questions.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the additional information. The menu options sound appealing, and I appreciate the clarity on the pricing and cancellation policy. I would like to move forward with your catering services for the gala dinner on March 15th for 80 guests. This brings the total to $3,600, which I understand is all-inclusive of VAT.  

Please let me know the next steps in securing the booking, and if you could send over the detailed menu options, that would be great.  

Best,
