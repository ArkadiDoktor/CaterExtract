Please let me know if you have specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I can provide you with some suggested dishes. Additionally, we can discuss beverage options if you're interested in including a bar service for the evening.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. Your proposal sounds promising. I appreciate the per-person pricing and the inclusion of VAT. However, I was wondering if you could offer a slight reduction for the price, considering we might have around 100 guests. Additionally, could you clarify if the food is kosher? We have some guests who adhere to strict dietary laws.  

As for the beverages, we are considering a separate arrangement, so let’s keep that out of the initial proposal for now.  

Thanks,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand your concern regarding pricing. I can offer a revised rate of 70 dollars per person for your guest count of approximately 100.  

Regarding the kosher requirements, I can confirm that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. We can provide a menu that includes a variety of dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of desserts. If you have any specific dietary accommodations in mind, just let me know, and we will do our best to cater to those needs.  

Please confirm if this adjustment works for you, and we can proceed to finalize the details.  

Best,
