We can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, with a focus on seasonal ingredients. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. This price covers a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200 guests. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council, should that be a requirement for your event.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility, especially if we end up with a higher guest count. We are expecting between 70 and 150 attendees, and I want to ensure we stay within budget.  

Could you also clarify if beverages are included in the package? We might want to consider a bar service as well. Lastly, could you provide a sample menu? It would help us visualize the options better.  

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. If the guest count exceeds 100, I can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person for the additional attendees. Regarding beverages, our base package does not include a bar, but we can certainly provide a full bar service at an additional cost.  

As for the menu, we can prepare a variety of dishes, including herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. I will send over a detailed sample menu shortly.  

Please let me know if there’s anything else you need.  

Best,
