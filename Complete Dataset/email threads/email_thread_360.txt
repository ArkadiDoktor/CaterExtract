For your event, we can offer a delightful mixed menu featuring a range of dishes, including herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable medley, and a selection of gourmet desserts. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing for the evening. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. 

Additionally, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide vegetarian options for any dietary restrictions. Please let me know if you're interested, and I can send over a detailed proposal.

Dear Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, and I'm glad to hear everything is kosher. I do have a few questions before moving forward. 

Is the $75 per person rate inclusive of VAT, or will that be added on top? Also, can you clarify if beverages are included in this price? Finally, we are considering around 120 guests but would like the option to reduce the number if necessary. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your questions. The price of $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. As for beverages, we can offer a separate bar package if you are interested. 

Regarding your guest list, we can certainly accommodate a range from 50 to 150 guests, and if you decide to reduce the numbers closer to the event, we require at least a week's notice for any adjustments. Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I can prepare a final proposal including the bar options.

Best,  
Michael
