Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights. We specialize in catering services for events, and I understand you are looking for catering for your upcoming gala on November 15th.  

We offer a diverse menu with options to accommodate various dietary needs. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the selections you choose. We can provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision from the local rabbinical authority.  

If you would like, I can provide a sample menu and discuss how we can meet your specific requirements, including beverages and setup arrangements.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed an important event for us, and I appreciate your willingness to provide a mixed menu. We are expecting between 150 to 200 guests, and I wanted to clarify if the pricing you mentioned includes VAT or if it will be added on top.  

We are also considering having a bar service. Could you confirm if that is included in your initial proposal or if it comes at an additional cost? Lastly, I would love to see the sample menu you mentioned.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your questions. The pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. Regarding the bar service, we can certainly include a basic beverage package, but for a full bar, there would be an additional cost.  

As for the sample menu, I have attached a few representative dishes we typically offer, including gourmet beef sliders, vegetable platters, and assorted desserts. We can also accommodate vegan and gluten-free options upon request.  

Please let me know if you have a specific budget in mind so we can tailor the offerings accordingly.  

Warm regards,
