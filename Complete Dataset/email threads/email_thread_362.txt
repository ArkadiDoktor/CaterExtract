Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your event on April 15th. We specialize in catering for corporate gatherings and would be delighted to provide our services for your needs. Our menu offers a variety of delicious options, including meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For a gathering of between 50 to 100 guests, we typically charge $35 per person, which includes VAT. Our standard package covers a mix of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, ensuring a satisfying experience for all attendees. We also offer dietary accommodations upon request, such as vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

If you would like to include a beverage service, we can discuss that as well. Please let me know if you have any specific menu preferences or if you would like to schedule a tasting.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The menu sounds great, but I'm looking to keep the costs a bit lower if possible. Would you be able to adjust the price to $30 per person? Also, could you clarify if the $35 includes a bar service or if that would be an additional charge?  

I'm planning for around 75 guests, so that would put the total at $2,250 if we can agree on that price. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate dietary needs, which is important for our team.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. While I understand the need to manage costs, I can offer you a package at $32 per person, which would total $2,400 for 75 guests. This price still includes VAT, and you will have a selection of our most popular dishes. However, the bar service would need to be arranged separately at an additional cost.  

Let me know if this works for you or if there are any other adjustments we can make to meet your budget.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I can accept the revised price of $32 per person, which totals $2,400 for 75 guests. Please confirm that the menu will include a variety of meat and dairy options and that the food will be kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision. I understand that bar service is not included, which is acceptable.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience, along with any details regarding setup and staffing. I appreciate your assistance with this event.
