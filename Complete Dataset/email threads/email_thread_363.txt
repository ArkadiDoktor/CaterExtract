Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed information. The menu you've suggested sounds great. However, we have about 100 attendees confirmed, and I wanted to know if you could offer a discount for this larger number. Also, could you clarify whether your meals can accommodate gluten-free and vegan options, as we have a few guests with those needs? 

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Lisa,  

I appreciate your continued interest in our catering services. For your group of 100, we can offer a discounted rate of $42 per person. As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide gluten-free and vegan options upon request, ensuring all guests can enjoy the meal. 

Please note that we will need confirmation at least two weeks prior to the event for any specific dietary requirements. The cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled within seven days of booking. 

Let me know if you would like to proceed with this revised offer.
