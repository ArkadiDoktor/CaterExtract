Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on November 12th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. Our team specializes in providing high-quality catering services for events like yours.  

For a wedding, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. This price includes VAT. We also provide kosher food under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

In terms of beverages, we can offer a full bar package as an add-on. We can also cater for dietary restrictions, so please let us know if any guests have specific needs.  

I look forward to discussing this further and helping make your wedding memorable.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate that you can accommodate dietary restrictions. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit, as we're working with a tighter budget. Would you be open to adjusting the per-person price to $65?  

Also, I wanted to confirm that the bar package is separate and could you provide me with a list of beverage options?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your budget considerations. While $65 is a bit lower than our standard pricing, I can offer you a special rate of $70 per person for your event if you can confirm the minimum of 50 guests. As for the bar, we can provide a selection of wines, spirits, and non-alcoholic beverages for an additional $25 per person.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a detailed menu for your review.  

Best,

Thank you for your flexibility. I can agree to the $70 per person rate for a minimum of 50 guests and would like to proceed with the bar package as well. Please send over the detailed menu so we can finalize everything. I also appreciate the cancellation policy details when you send the menu.  

Looking forward to working together!
