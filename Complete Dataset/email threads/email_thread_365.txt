Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on April 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to collaborate with you on this special occasion.  

Our catering services are known for their quality and attention to detail. We can provide a mixed menu featuring a variety of dishes, including options for both meat and dairy. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let us know if any guests require special meals.  

For pricing, we generally charge a fixed rate of £45 per person, which includes setup and staffing. This will cover a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. We handle all the necessary equipment for the event as well. Please note that our pricing does not include VAT, which is added on top.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din. If you wish, we can also include a selection of beverages, though this would be an additional cost.  

I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Carter

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the catering proposal. I appreciate the details regarding the pricing and menu options. However, given our budget constraints, I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the per-person charge. We are expecting around 100 guests, but if we can secure a better rate, that would be helpful.  

Also, could you clarify whether the VAT is included in the £45, or would it be added on top? Lastly, do you have any specific menu items in mind that you think would be a hit at the gala?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing. While £45 is our standard rate, I can offer a reduced price of £40 per person if you commit to 100 guests. This price remains exclusive of VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

As for the menu, I recommend our smoked salmon canapés, herb-crusted chicken, and a delightful vegan risotto, which tends to be popular with guests. We can also ensure that all meals are kosher, as previously mentioned.  

Please let me know if this works for your budget, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your revised offer. The price of £40 per person works for us, and I appreciate your suggestions for the menu items. I can confirm the catering for 100 guests, which brings the total to £4,000, plus VAT.  

I would like to proceed with the agreement under these terms. Please send over the contract and any details regarding the cancellation policy.  

Best,  
Sarah
