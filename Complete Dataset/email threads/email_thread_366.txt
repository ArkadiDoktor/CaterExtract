Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering services we can provide for your upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can accommodate a range of dietary requirements.  

For your event, we typically suggest a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing is structured at £45 per person, which includes a full three-course meal, as well as a selection of appetizers. We can cater to a minimum of 100 guests, and we can go up to a maximum of 200. Please note that VAT is included in this price.  

Additionally, we are certified kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din, ensuring all dietary laws are strictly followed. We can also provide options for guests with specific dietary needs, such as gluten-free and vegan meals.  

If you're interested, I would be happy to discuss this further and provide a sample menu for your review.  

Best regards,

Dear Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding your catering options. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher certification as well as the dietary accommodations. However, I wanted to clarify if the price is fixed at £45 per person for all guests, or if there are different options available.  

Also, I am considering the inclusion of a bar for drinks during the event. Does that come as part of your service, or would it be an additional cost? Finally, could you outline your cancellation policy in case we need to make changes closer to the date?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your questions. The £45 per person is indeed a fixed price for the full meal and includes VAT. However, we can provide an upgraded menu for £55 per person if you are interested in a more extensive selection, including premium meat options.  

Regarding the bar, we can offer a beverage package for an additional £15 per person, which includes wine, beer, and soft drinks for the duration of the event. As for the cancellation policy, we generally require at least 14 days' notice for a full refund.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the original proposal or consider the upgraded option.

Dear Mark,  

Thank you for the clarification. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the original proposal at £45 per person for 150 guests. We will also include the beverage package for an additional £15 per person. This brings the total to £9,000, which we are happy to confirm.  

Please let me know the next steps regarding the setup and staffing. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to working together to make this gala a success.
