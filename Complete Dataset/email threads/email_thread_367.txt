Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming conference on April 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with your event.  

To ensure we meet your needs, could you please provide the expected number of guests? We typically cater events for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. Our pricing is based on a per-person structure, with a range of options available depending on the menu selection.  

We offer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options, and all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K. We can also provide dietary accommodations for guests with specific needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting around 120 guests for the conference, so that fits well within your range. I appreciate the kosher options and dietary accommodations.  

Could you provide an idea of your pricing per person and what the final package might include? Additionally, I would like to confirm whether VAT is included in the pricing or will be added on top. We are also considering whether to include a bar service or beverages, so if you could clarify that as well, it would be helpful.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

As for beverages, we can offer a bar service for an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. If you decide to go with our catering service, we can arrange for setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the day of the event.
