Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding on October 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special occasion for you. Our team specializes in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs, ensuring all guests enjoy a memorable meal.  

For a mixed menu, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. This pricing is inclusive of VAT, and our offerings are kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher certification.  

We also provide staff and necessary equipment for setup and service. However, beverages are not included in this price. Please let us know if you have any specific dishes in mind or dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided about the catering options. The $75 per person seems a bit steep considering our budget constraints. Would you be able to offer a lower price if we were to finalize the guest count closer to the date? Additionally, could you clarify if you can accommodate vegan options within your menu?  

I’m looking forward to understanding how we can make this work while ensuring a great experience for our guests.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding the budget. If you can confirm a final guest count of at least 70 guests, I can offer you a reduced rate of $68 per person. We can certainly include vegan options in the menu as well. As for accommodating changes in guest count, we can be flexible, but any significant adjustments must be communicated at least one week prior to the event.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, and I’ll be happy to send over a formal proposal.  

Best,
