Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to offer our catering services for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food tailored to specific dietary needs and preferences.  

For your event, I can propose a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken, vegetarian pasta, and seasonal salads. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes setup, serving staff, and all necessary equipment. Please let me know your expected guest count, as we can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests.  

Additionally, our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK Kosher Certification, and we can certainly discuss beverage options should you require them.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate the mixed menu options you provided. However, I was hoping to see if we could negotiate the price to $40 per person, as our budget is a bit tight.  

I also wanted to confirm if the price you mentioned includes VAT or if that would be an additional cost. Could you also clarify if you offer any specific dietary accommodations for guests with allergies?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply and for considering our services. I understand the need to stay within budget, and I can meet you at the $40 per person rate if you can commit to a minimum of 75 guests. Regarding VAT, that is included in the price.  

We are well-equipped to handle various dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and nut-free options, ensuring all guests can enjoy their meals. I can also provide non-alcoholic beverages if that is something you'd like to include.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you.  

Best,
