Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, especially the grilled chicken. However, I wanted to clarify a few points. The price of $75 per person is slightly above our initial budget. Would you be open to negotiating this? Also, could you confirm if the quoted price includes VAT?  

Additionally, we are expecting around 150 guests, so I would appreciate your thoughts on potential dietary accommodations for gluten-free and vegetarian options.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stick to a budget. I can offer a revised price of $70 per person if we finalize the guest count at 150, and yes, the price does include VAT. As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide gluten-free and vegetarian options to ensure all guests are catered for.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I would be happy to finalize the details, including the inclusion of a full bar at an additional cost if you're interested.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the adjustments and clarifications. I am pleased to accept your proposal of $70 per person for 150 guests, including VAT, along with the dietary accommodations. Please confirm that the final menu will include the grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and salads, and we will not need the bar service for this event.  

I appreciate your help in making this happen. Let's proceed with the agreement, and I would like to ensure that we have a cancellation policy in place for any unforeseen circumstances.  

Best,
