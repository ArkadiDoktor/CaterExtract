Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. We can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. 

For pricing, we typically charge $75 per person with a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250. This price includes VAT and covers a buffet-style setup with staff assistance throughout the evening. Our menu highlights include herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet desserts. 

Please let me know if you're interested or if you have any specific dietary requirements we should be aware of, and I will be happy to accommodate.

Best regards,

Dear David,

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds wonderful, especially the herb-crusted chicken. However, we're considering a few additional options for beverages. Would it be possible to include a bar service as well, or would that be an additional cost? 

Additionally, we are expecting around 150 guests, but we want to ensure we can adjust for a maximum of 200 if needed. Could you confirm if the price would remain the same for that range?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your interest in including bar service. We can definitely provide that for an additional $25 per person, which includes a selection of wine, beer, and non-alcoholic beverages. If you decide to go with the maximum of 200 guests, the overall price would then be $100 per person for the catering and bar combined.

Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than two weeks prior to the event. Let me know if this works for you or if you have any other questions.

Best regards,
