Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Culinary Delights for your upcoming wedding reception on March 10th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to cater your event.  

We offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and our menu features popular dishes like herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable medley, and a selection of gourmet desserts.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher food under the supervision of the Orthodox Rabbinical Council. However, drinks and bar services are not included in the package. We can discuss beverage options separately if you're interested.  

Please let me know if you’d like to proceed, or if you have any questions or specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the kosher options, and the menu sounds delicious. However, I was wondering if there's any flexibility in the pricing if we were to confirm a smaller guest count, perhaps around 80 to 100 guests? Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy should our plans change?  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear you liked the menu. For a smaller group of 80 to 100 guests, we can adjust the pricing to $80 per person, still inclusive of VAT. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require notice at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund. I hope this works for you, and I’m happy to discuss any dietary accommodations needed for your guests.  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed.  

Warm regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for the revised proposal and the clarity on the cancellation policy. I’m pleased to confirm our catering arrangement for 100 guests at $80 per person. We will expect the kosher menu under the Orthodox Rabbinical Council supervision, and we'll handle the bar separately.  

Please let me know what you need from our side to finalize this. Looking forward to a wonderful event!  

Best,
