Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your quick reply. We are planning a wedding reception on June 15th, and we expect around 100 to 150 guests. We would like a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Additionally, it’s important that the food is kosher, preferably under the supervision of a recognized authority. Could you also clarify the pricing structure?  

I look forward to your proposal!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your detailed response. For your wedding reception, we can provide a mixed menu that includes items such as grilled chicken, salmon, and a variety of vegetarian options. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. For 100 guests, the total would be $7,500, and we can accommodate up to 150 guests if needed. We can also create a bar package for additional costs if you’d like to include beverages.  

Our kosher meals are under the supervision of the Local Kosher Authority. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free and vegan options. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can discuss the cancellation terms and any extra notes you may need regarding setup and staffing.
