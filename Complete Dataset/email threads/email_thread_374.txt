Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Michael Cohen from Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand that you are organizing a wedding reception on December 15th, and I would love to discuss catering options for your event.  

We specialize in providing a variety of menu choices, including kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian meals. Our pricing typically starts at $75 per person, which includes a full buffet service and staffing. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

Please let me know if you would like to set up a time to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information about your catering services. I am particularly interested in the kosher options and would like to know more about the specific menu items you offer.  

Also, could you clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT? We are expecting around 100 guests, but I’d like to keep the option open for more. Finally, could you confirm whether beverages are included in this pricing?  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final cost. As for the menu, we can provide a mixed menu featuring dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads. We can also offer a selection of beverages for an additional fee.  

For your wedding of approximately 100 guests, the total would come to $7,500 before VAT. We do require a deposit for confirmation, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least 30 days before the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best regards,
