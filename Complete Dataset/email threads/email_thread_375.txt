Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I’d like to clarify a couple of points. We are expecting about 100 guests, and I appreciate that the pricing includes VAT. However, could you confirm if the beverage package is mandatory? We might prefer to handle drinks separately.  

Also, would you be able to provide some specific menu highlights? We want to ensure a variety of options that would appeal to our guests. Finally, can you outline your cancellation policy in case our numbers change?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah Thompson

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The beverage package is optional, so you can certainly choose to manage that on your own. As for the menu highlights, we can offer options such as grilled salmon, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of gourmet salads. We also have a delightful dessert table featuring assorted pastries and a chocolate fountain.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to two weeks before the event for a full refund of any deposits made. After that, we can only provide a partial refund depending on costs incurred.  

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you're ready to proceed.  

Best wishes,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the additional information. Everything looks great, and I appreciate your flexibility with the beverage options. I would like to move forward with the catering for 100 guests at the per-person rate. This brings the total to $7,500, including VAT, and I would like to proceed with the kosher menu under the supervision of the Kashrut Authority.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
