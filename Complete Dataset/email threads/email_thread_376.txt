Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our team specializes in offering a diverse menu that can be tailored to suit your guests' preferences.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, we can offer a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a selection of starters, main courses, and desserts. Our menu features a mix of meat and dairy options, and we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.  

Please note that our food is kosher and supervised by the local Kashrut authority. We typically recommend including beverages at an additional cost, but we can discuss this further based on your preferences. VAT is included in the quoted price.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The price of $75 per person sounds reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points. We anticipate around 80 guests, so would you be able to accommodate that number? Additionally, could you provide examples of some of the main dishes you would offer?  

I would also like to confirm whether the beverages can be included in the per-person price or if they are strictly separate, as we are trying to stay within our budget.  

Thank you again for your assistance.  

Best,  
Rachel

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, we can certainly accommodate 80 guests. In terms of main dishes, we could offer options such as herb-roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a vegetarian stuffed pepper.  

Regarding beverages, we can offer a package that includes soft drinks and wine for an additional $15 per person. This would bring the total to $90 per person, but I can assure you it will enhance the dining experience. If you decide to go with our initial offer, the beverages would indeed be separate.  

Please let me know your thoughts!  

Best,  
Mark
