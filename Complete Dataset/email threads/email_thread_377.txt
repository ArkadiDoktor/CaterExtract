Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We specialize in providing exceptional catering services for events just like yours.  

For your guest list of approximately 100 attendees, I propose a mixed menu, featuring an array of delectable dishes. Our pricing is set at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards are maintained.  

We can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free options, and we will provide all necessary equipment for serving. Please note that our pricing does not include VAT, which will be added at the time of billing.  

I would be happy to discuss this further and fine-tune any details to fit your vision for the event.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I wanted to clarify if the $50 per person pricing is flexible, as we might have between 80 to 120 guests depending on final confirmations. Also, I would like to know if beverages, including a bar service, are included in this price or if they are separate.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Warm regards,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your email. I can certainly adjust the pricing for varying guest numbers. If we go with a minimum of 80 guests, the price will remain at $50 per person, but if we reach 120 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person. However, beverages would be priced separately, with a standard bar package available for an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wine, beer, and soft drinks.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can draft a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the revised pricing structure. I am happy to proceed with the option for 100 guests at $50 per person, along with the bar package for an additional $15 per person. Thus, the total would be $6,500, excluding VAT. Please confirm that this includes all necessary setup and staffing. I’ll also need to understand the cancellation policy before finalizing.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
