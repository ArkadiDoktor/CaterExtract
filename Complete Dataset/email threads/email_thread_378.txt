Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Conference  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand you are organizing a conference on October 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can provide catering for this event.  

We specialize in a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing typically ranges from $45 to $65 per person, depending on the selections you choose. This includes setup and staff for the duration of the event. We can also provide beverages, though please let me know if you would like a bar service included.  

I look forward to your response so we can tailor the menu to fit your needs.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The conference will have between 100 and 150 attendees, and we are leaning towards a menu that includes both meat and dairy options. I appreciate the range in pricing, but could you confirm if VAT is included in those figures?  

Additionally, we are looking for kosher options, preferably under reliable supervision. If you could provide some menu highlights and let me know about the cancellation policy, that would be great.  

Thanks again for your assistance!

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I can confirm that the pricing I provided does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. We can certainly offer a kosher menu, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all necessary guidelines.  

As for menu highlights, I recommend our herb-marinated chicken, a selection of seasonal roasted vegetables, and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert. For the cancellation policy, we require notice at least seven days prior to the event for a full refund.  

Considering your guest count, I can offer a fixed price of $55 per person, which would total $8,250 for 150 guests. This includes service staff and setup. Please let me know if this works for you.
