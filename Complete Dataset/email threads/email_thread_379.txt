Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your quick response. I appreciate the information about your menu. Considering our budget and guest list, I would like to clarify if there’s any flexibility in pricing, especially if we confirm more than 100 guests. Also, could you confirm whether your dishes are kosher and under what supervision? Additionally, we are interested in having a bar at the event.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person if you confirm 100 guests or more. All our dishes are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. As for the bar, it is not included in the initial quote but we can provide a selection of beverages for an additional fee.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu and discuss other details such as setup and staffing.  

Warm regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your flexibility and the clarification on the kosher supervision. I would like to proceed with the catering at the rate of $70 per person for 100 guests. This brings the total to $7,000, and I understand that VAT is included in this pricing. Please prepare the necessary documents, including details on cancellation terms, and let’s discuss the final menu selection soon.
