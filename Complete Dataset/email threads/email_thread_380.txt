Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your event on March 15th at the Downtown Conference Center. We would be delighted to provide our services. Our catering packages include a variety of menu options, with a focus on mixed cuisine that can accommodate dietary restrictions.  

For a guest count of 50 to 100 attendees, our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary needs are met.  

Please note that beverages and bar service are not included in this price, but we can offer a separate package if you are interested. The quoted price does include VAT, and we have a flexible cancellation policy allowing for full refunds if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu preferences in mind.

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I’d like to confirm that we will have approximately 75 guests. Can you clarify if there are options for a dairy menu? Additionally, I would be interested in knowing the final cost, including any potential upgrades for the dessert selections.  

As for drinks, we might consider a bar package depending on the overall pricing. Could you let me know if there are any minimum requirements for the bar service?  

Looking forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I can confirm that we can offer a dairy menu option for your event. For dessert upgrades, the final price would be $50 per person, which includes a gourmet dessert selection along with the standard offerings.  

Regarding the bar service, we typically require a minimum of 50 guests to set up a bar, and we can provide a variety of packages starting at an additional $20 per person. Both the dairy menu and upgraded desserts are kosher, under the same supervision.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if you have further questions.
