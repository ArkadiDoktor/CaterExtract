We specialize in a range of menu options and can offer a selection of mixed dishes that include both meat and dairy, ensuring we cater to diverse dietary needs. Our pricing is structured at $55 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

We also provide kosher options that are certified under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can offer a range of beverages, including a full bar setup for an additional cost.

Hi Samantha,  

Thank you for your quick response. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, I wanted to clarify a few details. If we decide to go ahead with 100 guests, would there be any flexibility on the price? Additionally, can you confirm if the $55 per person includes all service staff and equipment setup?  

We are also considering the possibility of including some non-alcoholic beverages in the package. It would be great to have an idea of what those options might look like.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Hannah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For an event with 100 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of $50 per person, which still includes VAT and all staffing for setup and service. As for the non-alcoholic beverages, we can include a selection of sodas and juices at no extra cost, while a full bar would remain an additional expense.  

If you decide to proceed, our cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event date without penalty. Let me know if this works for your budget or if you need further adjustments.  

Best regards,
