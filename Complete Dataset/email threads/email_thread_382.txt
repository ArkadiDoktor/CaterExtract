Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your corporate retreat scheduled for November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

We specialize in a diverse range of menus, including options that are kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 100 guests. This price includes VAT, and while we focus primarily on a mixed menu, we can also provide vegetarian options upon request.  

Please let us know if you would like to discuss specific menu items. We typically offer dishes such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetable platters, and a selection of desserts. Additionally, we can arrange for beverages, although a full bar is not included in the base price.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt reply. The menu sounds appealing, especially the grilled chicken and roasted vegetables. However, given our budget constraints, I was hoping to negotiate the price per person. Would you be willing to consider a fixed price of $40 per person?  

Also, can you confirm if the kosher supervision is indeed from the Orthodox Union? We want to ensure everything meets our dietary requirements. Furthermore, are there any options for gluten-free meals?  

Appreciate your help as we finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick response. I can adjust the price to $42 per person, which would still allow us to provide high-quality ingredients and service. Yes, I can confirm that all kosher items will be under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can certainly accommodate gluten-free dietary needs as well.  

Regarding drinks, if you decide to include a beverage package, we can offer that separately. Let me know your thoughts on the pricing, and I can prepare a more detailed menu for your review.  

Best,
