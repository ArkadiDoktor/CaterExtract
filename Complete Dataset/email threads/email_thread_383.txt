Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming charity gala on December 15th. We specialize in events like yours and would love to help create a memorable experience.  

For a mixed menu, we can offer a selection of delicious appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and up to 200 guests. If you would like, we can also provide kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.

Hi Mark,  

Thanks for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. We’re excited about the potential for a wonderful menu. However, I wanted to clarify if the $75 price per person includes beverages, as we are looking to provide a full experience for our guests. Additionally, we might have a few dietary restrictions to consider, such as vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Could you also let me know the cancellation policy in case our plans change? Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person price does not include a bar service, but we can arrange a beverage package for an additional $20 per person if you decide to include it. We can certainly accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options within the mixed menu.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we offer a full refund if you cancel at least two weeks prior to the event. If you have any further questions or specific dishes in mind, please let me know.  

Best,
