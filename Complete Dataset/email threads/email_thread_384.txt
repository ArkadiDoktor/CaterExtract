Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering for your wedding reception scheduled for June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food and service for such events.  

For your occasion, we can offer a mixed menu, including options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, and this includes setup and staff for the event. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and I can confirm that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further or if you have any specific dietary requirements.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound fantastic. However, I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person price includes VAT or if that will be added on top. Additionally, could you confirm whether beverages are part of the package? We are expecting around 120 guests and would appreciate options for dietary accommodations, particularly for gluten-free and vegan guests.  

Looking forward to your update.  

Best,  
Jessica

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your questions. The price of $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. As for beverages, we do not include them in the package, but I can provide a separate quote for a bar service if you're interested. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegan options as part of the menu.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,

Thank you for clarifying the pricing details. I appreciate your flexibility with dietary options. I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests at the price of $75 each, plus VAT. Please include gluten-free and vegan options in the menu. I also request a separate quote for the bar services.  

Could you please confirm the cancellation policy? Once I have that, we can finalize the agreement.
