Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us about catering your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. We can provide a variety of options tailored to your needs, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes.  

Our pricing is structured at twenty-five dollars per person, and we can accommodate groups of up to one hundred guests. This price includes VAT. We also offer various dietary accommodations, so please let us know if there are any specific requirements.  

In terms of beverages, we can provide a separate bar service if needed, though it would not be included in the base price. For kosher requirements, our meals are prepared under strict supervision by the local rabbinical council.  

Let me know if you’d like to discuss this further or if you have any specific menu items in mind.  

Best regards,

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information regarding the catering options. I appreciate that you can offer a mixed menu and accommodate various dietary needs. However, given our budget constraints, we are hoping to keep the total cost below two thousand dollars.  

Could you let me know if there is flexibility in the price per person or possible adjustments to the menu that could help us meet our budget? Additionally, we are expecting between fifty to seventy guests, so I would like to ensure that this is still feasible.  

Looking forward to your suggestions.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback regarding the budget. I'm happy to work with you on this. If we adjust the menu slightly to feature fewer premium items, I can offer a revised price of twenty-two dollars per person. This would keep the total for seventy guests at one thousand five hundred forty dollars, which is within your budget.  

We can still maintain a variety of options, including some delicious pasta dishes and salads as part of the menu. Please let me know if this adjustment works for you. I’m also happy to discuss any other specific items you have in mind.  

Warm regards,

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for the revised proposal. The adjusted price of twenty-two dollars per person works perfectly for our budget. Please confirm that the total for seventy guests will indeed be one thousand five hundred forty dollars, and I understand that VAT is included in this price.  

I appreciate your flexibility with the menu options and look forward to finalizing the details. If you could send over the menu highlights and contract details, that would be great. I also want to confirm that we will not require a bar service for this event.  

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to working together!
