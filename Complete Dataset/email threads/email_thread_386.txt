Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing of $45 per person sounds reasonable, but I wanted to clarify what is included in that price. Does it cover beverages as well, or would that be additional? Also, could you provide a few examples of the menu items you typically offer?  

I appreciate that you can cater for up to 200 guests, but what is your cancellation policy in case we need to adjust the numbers closer to the event?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person price includes all food items, but beverages are not included. We typically offer a variety of drinks at an additional cost if you are interested.  

As for the menu, some highlights include herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and assorted mini pastries for dessert. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days before the event to avoid any cancellation fees.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further questions.  

Warm regards,  
Mark Thompson
