For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, we propose a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with notable dishes including herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a decadent chocolate mousse for dessert. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian needs.

Hi Martin,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed menu suggestions. The pricing looks good, but we are expecting closer to 80 guests. Can you confirm if the price remains the same for that number? Additionally, we would like to ensure that all food is kosher, preferably under the supervision of the OU. Lastly, could you clarify if beverages are included in the price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your questions. For 80 guests, the price will still be $45 per person, and this includes VAT. I can confirm that all food will be kosher and supervised by the OU. However, the beverage service, including a bar, is not included in this pricing but can be arranged for an additional $15 per person.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Martin,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. We would like to proceed with the catering for 80 guests at the agreed price of $45 per person, which includes the kosher menu under OU supervision. However, we will not be including the bar service at this time. I appreciate your assistance in making accommodations for dietary restrictions.  

Please send over the contract and any cancellation terms at your earliest convenience.  

Best regards,
