Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering services for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Our team specializes in providing a diverse menu that suits various dietary preferences, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests to a maximum of 200 guests.  

For this particular event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. All of our food is prepared under strict rabbinical supervision, ensuring it meets kosher standards. We typically charge $75 per person, which includes VAT. Please note that beverages are not included in this rate, but we can create a separate package for that.  

We pride ourselves on being flexible, so if you have any specific dishes in mind or dietary restrictions to consider, just let us know, and we can tailor the menu to fit your needs.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you.  

Best regards,

Hello David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. I appreciate the flexibility in the menu and your kosher certification. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit as we have a limited budget for this event. Would you be able to reduce the price to $65 per person while still offering a varied selection? Additionally, could you confirm if your cancellation policy allows for any full refunds if we decide to cancel within a week of the event?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I understand budget constraints, and I can offer a special rate of $70 per person instead of $75. This would still provide a wide array of menu options, including vegetarian dishes to accommodate various dietary needs. Regarding the cancellation policy, we typically offer a full refund for cancellations made at least two weeks before the event. Unfortunately, we cannot provide refunds for cancellations made within that timeframe.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can start finalizing the details.  

Best,
