Hi Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse range of culinary options tailored to suit various events, and I would love to assist you with this one.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a selection of meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. The menu can feature dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, roasted vegetable platters, and a variety of salads. We can also accommodate any dietary restrictions you may have, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Please note that our cancellation policy allows for changes up to a week before the event without penalties. If you'd like, we can set up a time to discuss further details or any specific requests you may have.

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the flexibility in accommodating dietary restrictions as we have several guests who require special meals. However, I’d like to clarify the pricing a bit. Would there be opportunities for a discount if we finalize the guest count closer to 150? Also, can you confirm if the food will be kosher and under what supervision?  

I’m also considering including a bar for the evening. Is that something you provide, or would I need to arrange that separately?  

Looking forward to your answers.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your questions. If you can confirm a guest count of 150, we can offer a fixed price of $4,000, which keeps the per-person rate the same while providing a bit of a discount due to the higher number. Regarding the kosher status, all of our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets the necessary dietary laws.  

As for beverages, we can provide a bar service at an additional cost, which would typically range from $15 to $25 per person depending on the selection. If you prefer, we can discuss a package that includes both food and beverages.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.
