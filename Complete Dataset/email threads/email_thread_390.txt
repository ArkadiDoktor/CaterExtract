We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250. All our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a separate bar service if desired, which would be priced additionally.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The community gala is indeed a significant event for us, and we want to ensure everything is perfect. I appreciate the kosher certification and the mixed menu options. However, I wanted to clarify whether the $50 per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top.  

Additionally, our guest count might fluctuate, so could you let me know if there are any cancellation terms I should be aware of? We are also considering whether to include a bar service, so could you provide a rough estimate for that as well?  

Thank you again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The $50 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made.  

As for the bar service, we can offer a range of options starting at $15 per person, based on a selection of wines and beers. If you decide to move forward with the catering, we can finalize all the details to ensure everything aligns with your expectations.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,
