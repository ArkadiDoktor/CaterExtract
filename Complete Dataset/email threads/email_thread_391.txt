Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We are excited to potentially be a part of your special day.

We also provide a selection of beverages, including soft drinks and a limited bar option, but please let us know if you need a more extensive bar service.  

Some of our menu highlights include grilled chicken with rosemary, roasted vegetable platters, and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert. We can also cater to various dietary restrictions, so please share any specific needs you may have.

Hi David,  

I appreciate your quick response. The menu options sound wonderful, especially the grilled chicken. I wanted to clarify a couple of points. Could you confirm whether the $75 per person rate covers everything, including service and setup? Additionally, we are expecting around 120 guests, but we might go up to 150, depending on responses.  

Also, it would be helpful to know more about the dietary accommodations you can offer. Are there options for vegan guests?  

Thank you for your assistance,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Yes, the $75 per person does include service, setup, and all necessary equipment for the event. We can certainly accommodate vegan options, such as a flavorful quinoa salad and a stir-fried vegetable dish, ensuring that all guests feel catered to.  

For your potential guest count, I recommend finalizing your numbers closer to the date, but we can handle adjustments to a maximum of 150 guests. Just a reminder, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled 30 days prior to the event, but after that, we would need to discuss potential fees.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed, and I can send over a formal agreement.  

Best,
