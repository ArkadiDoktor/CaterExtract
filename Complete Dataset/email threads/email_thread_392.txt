Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to assist you with the catering.  

We offer a diverse menu, including a selection of meat and dairy dishes, and our food is prepared under strict rabbinical supervision, making it kosher. Our pricing starts at $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can comfortably cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200, and we can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

If you’d like, I can send over a sample menu for your review. Please let me know your preferences, and we can discuss the details further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed quite important to us, and I appreciate your willingness to cater. I would love to see the sample menu you mentioned.  

I noticed that the starting price is $50 per person, but considering our budget constraints, would you be open to discussing a fixed price for the entire event? We are aiming for around 125 guests, and it would be great to get a comprehensive package that includes everything, perhaps even some beverage options.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your interest in our catering services. I understand the budget is a key factor, and I’d be happy to offer a fixed price of $6,000 for 125 guests, which would cover a three-course meal, staff for setup and service, and all necessary equipment. This price does include VAT.  

As for beverages, we can include a selection of soft drinks and juices, but if you're looking for a full bar, that would be an additional cost. I can send you a detailed menu that outlines our offerings, including some of our most popular dishes like herb-marinated chicken and a delicious vegetarian lasagna.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick reply and for accommodating our request. The fixed price of $6,000 for 125 guests sounds reasonable, and I appreciate that VAT is included. I would like to proceed with this arrangement. Please send over the menu, and let’s also discuss the final details regarding the bar options.  

Could you also clarify your cancellation policy? It’s always good to have that on record. Looking forward to working together to make our event a success!
