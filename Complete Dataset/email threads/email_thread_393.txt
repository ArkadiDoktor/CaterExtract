Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, could we consider a slight adjustment to the price per person? Our budget is a bit tighter, and I was hoping for something closer to £40 per person.  

Also, could you clarify if this includes beverages, as we are considering whether to have a bar at the event?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,

Hi Rachel,  

I understand your budget constraints and can offer you a price of £42 per person, which includes VAT. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in this price, but we can provide a bar service at an additional cost.  

If you decide to move forward, we can create a delightful menu featuring dishes such as herb-crusted lamb and a selection of seasonal sides. We also provide staff for setup and service, ensuring everything runs smoothly during the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
