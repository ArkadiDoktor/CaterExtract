Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding your request for catering services for the upcoming gala on March 15th. We specialize in events like this and have a variety of menu options available.  

For this particular event, we offer a two-course meal starting at a price of $45 per person, which includes a choice of an appetizer and a main course. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and our pricing includes VAT.  

Our menu can be tailored to meet dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free choices. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. We also provide beverage services as part of the package.  

Let me know if you have any specific requirements or if you would like to discuss this further.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed an exciting event for us, and I appreciate the details you've provided. However, I was hoping to clarify a couple of things.  

Could you confirm if the $45 per person price includes both the meal and beverages, or are drinks charged separately? Additionally, we might have around 250 guests attending, so would you be open to adjusting the price if we exceed the initial estimate?  

Let me know your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person does include the meal and standard beverages, but if you're expecting around 250 guests, I can offer a discounted rate of $40 per person for that number. We can also work on additional beverage options if you'd like to enhance the offering.  

Please note that we can handle up to 300 guests, so we are flexible in terms of numbers. Also, our cancellation policy allows for full refunds if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

I hope this helps, and I look forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thanks for clarifying the details. I’m happy to proceed with your proposal at $40 per person for 250 guests, which brings the total to $10,000. I appreciate the inclusion of VAT and the kosher supervision.  

Please confirm that the menu will consist of a meat-based selection with options for vegetarian and gluten-free guests, as well as the beverage service. I will ensure that we adhere to the cancellation policy you mentioned.  

Looking forward to working together on this event.  

Best,
