Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our offerings include a variety of dishes, with a focus on a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options.  

Our pricing is structured at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. Please note that this price includes VAT, and we can provide kosher food under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority.  

Additionally, we can arrange for a full bar, but that would be an extra cost. We are also able to cater to various dietary restrictions, so please let us know if any guests require special accommodations.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, the price is a bit higher than we anticipated. Would you be able to offer a discount if we can confirm a guest count closer to 150? Additionally, can you clarify if the bar service is included in the $50 per person price or if that is separate?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. If you confirm 150 guests, we can adjust the rate to $45 per person. The bar service would be an additional cost, around $15 per person, for a standard open bar. This can be customized based on your preferences, of course.  

Please let me know if this revised proposal works for you. We want to ensure your event is memorable and meets your budgetary needs.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the revised pricing. I appreciate your flexibility. We would like to confirm the catering for 150 guests at $45 per person, making the total $6,750. We will go with the standard open bar for an additional $15 per person as well. Please ensure that all food is kosher under the supervision you mentioned.  

I also want to confirm that the cancellation policy allows for changes up to five days before the event. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything.  

Best regards,
