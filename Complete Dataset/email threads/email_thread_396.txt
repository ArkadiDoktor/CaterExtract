Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The corporate gala is indeed a significant occasion for us, and I appreciate your interest in catering. Before we proceed, I wanted to clarify a few points.  

Are the prices you mentioned inclusive of VAT? Also, could you provide details on whether your menu options are kosher? Our attendees would appreciate this, especially if you could specify the supervision under which the food is prepared. Additionally, we are considering including a bar service, so I would like to know if that can be arranged and if it's included in your pricing.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up questions. The pricing I provided does not include VAT, which will be added on top. I’m pleased to confirm that we can offer kosher catering under the supervision of the Vaad Hakashrut.  

Regarding the bar service, we can certainly include that as part of our package, and I will provide a separate quote based on your preferences. Our standard menu features a variety of meat dishes, but we can customize it to accommodate specific dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

If we can agree on a final menu and guest count, I would estimate the total cost for 100 guests at approximately $5,500, inclusive of setup and staffing. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

Thank you for the detailed response. I appreciate your flexibility in accommodating our dietary needs and the kosher supervision. The estimated total of $5,500 for 100 guests works well for us, and I would like to proceed with your services.  

Could you please confirm the cancellation policy and any additional notes regarding setup and equipment? Once I have that information, we can finalize the agreement.
