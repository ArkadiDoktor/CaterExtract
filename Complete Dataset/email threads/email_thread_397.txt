Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater your company’s annual gala. We specialize in a variety of cuisines, and we can provide a delicious menu tailored to your needs.  

For a seated dinner, we generally recommend a mixed menu, which can include options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled salmon, and a variety of vegetarian dishes. Our pricing typically starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and we also offer options for dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan dishes.  

Please let us know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate that you can accommodate dietary needs. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Given our budget constraints, would it be possible to lower the cost to $40 per person? Additionally, can you confirm if the food will be kosher and under what supervision?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your understanding. We can adjust the price to $40 per person, and I can confirm that all food will be kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. However, please note that the final price will still include VAT.  

Regarding the bar, we typically do not include beverages in the base price, but we can offer a full bar package as an additional option. If we finalize this, I will ensure we have staff on-site for setup and service.  

Let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for accommodating my request. I appreciate the confirmation on the kosher supervision. I’d like to proceed with the agreement at $40 per person for 120 guests, which brings us to a total of $4,800. Can we also include a basic beverage package? Please confirm the cancellation terms so we can finalize everything.  

Thanks again for your assistance.
