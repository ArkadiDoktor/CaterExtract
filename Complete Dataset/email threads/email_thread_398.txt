Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your catering needs. We would be delighted to assist with the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse range of menu options, including meat and dairy dishes, which can be tailored to meet your guests' dietary requirements.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which typically ranges from $50 to $75 depending on the final menu selection. This includes all necessary staff and equipment for setup. We can also offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

To provide you with a more detailed proposal, could you please confirm the expected number of guests? Our services can accommodate between 50 and 200 attendees. Also, let me know if you require a bar service, as that would be an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. We are expecting around 120 guests, and I appreciate the information on your pricing structure. I would like to clarify if the $50 to $75 range includes VAT or if it is added on top of the quoted prices.  

Additionally, we are interested in including a bar service and would like to know what drink options you can provide. It is also important for us to have some vegetarian options available alongside the meat dishes.  

Could you please send a sample menu along with your cancellation policy?  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your quick reply and your interest in our services. The pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. For the bar, we can offer a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks that can be tailored to your preferences.  

Regarding the menu, we can certainly provide vegetarian options alongside our meat dishes. I will include a sample menu for you to review. Our cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event, after which a fee may apply.  

Once you review the sample menu, please let me know if it meets your expectations, and I can provide a final quote based on 120 guests.  

Best,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for the additional information. After reviewing the sample menu, I am pleased with the options you have provided, especially the inclusion of vegetarian dishes. I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests at a quoted price of $60 per person, which includes the bar service as well. I understand VAT will be applied on top of that.  

Please confirm that the kosher meals will be under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and I would appreciate it if you could send over a formal agreement outlining the details.  

Looking forward to finalizing our arrangement.  

Best,
