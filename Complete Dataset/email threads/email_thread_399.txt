Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound great. However, we are hoping to keep costs down a bit. Would you be able to offer a fixed price for a slightly simpler menu? Additionally, I want to confirm whether the meals are kosher and if so, what supervision you have in place.  

Could you also clarify if beverages are included in the $45 price? We are expecting around 120 guests for the evening.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. I can offer you a simplified menu that would bring the price down to $40 per person. This would still include our kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. The beverages, however, are not included in the meal price and would be an additional $10 per guest if you would like a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

Let me know if this works for your budget, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the adjustments. I’m happy to accept the offer of $40 per person for the simplified kosher menu. We will also proceed with the additional beverages for $10 each. This brings us to a total of $6,000 for 120 guests, including VAT. Please confirm the cancellation policy and any extra notes regarding setup or staffing.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
