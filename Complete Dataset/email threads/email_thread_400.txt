Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Samantha,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the catering services for your corporate gala scheduled for April 15th. We specialize in providing an exquisite dining experience, and I believe we can create a menu that your guests will love.

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, accommodating various dietary restrictions. Our pricing generally starts at $75 per person, and we require a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150. This price includes VAT, and we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu preferences in mind. We can also arrange for beverages, but they are not included in the base price.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a few details. We are expecting around 100 guests, and I would like to confirm if the $75 price includes all setup and staffing, or if those costs are additional. 

Also, could you provide a few examples of the menu items you typically offer? We want to ensure there are enough options for guests with dietary restrictions, especially those who are vegetarian or gluten-free.

I appreciate your help with this.

Best,

Hi Samantha,

Thanks for your questions. The $75 per person does include all setup and staffing for the event, so you won’t have any surprises there. As for the menu, we can offer dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, a variety of vegetarian pastas, and seasonal vegetable platters. We can also accommodate gluten-free requests and ensure that vegetarian options are plentiful. 

If you're ready to proceed, I can hold the date for you while we finalize the details. Please remember our cancellation policy allows for full refunds if you cancel at least two weeks in advance.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Warm regards,

Once confirmed, I will send over the deposit to secure our booking.
