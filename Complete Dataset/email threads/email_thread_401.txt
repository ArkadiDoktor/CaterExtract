Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights Catering. We are excited about the opportunity to cater your corporate dinner scheduled for April 15th. Based on your guest count of approximately 50 to 80 attendees, we can offer a mixed menu that includes various meat and dairy options.

Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free meals, ensuring that all guests have enjoyable options. Please let us know if you require kosher supervision; we can arrange this under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.

In addition to the meal, we can provide staff for setup and serving. However, beverages are not included in the base price but can be added based on your preferences.

Looking forward to your feedback on this proposal.

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. The menu sounds great, but I would like to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, is there any flexibility on the $45 per person rate? Additionally, can you confirm what the cancellation terms would be, just in case our plans change?

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,

I understand your concerns regarding the budget. We can reduce the price to $40 per person if we adjust the menu slightly to focus on fewer options. This still allows us to provide a satisfying meal for your guests. As for the cancellation policy, we typically require a 14-day notice for full refunds.

Let me know if this adjustment works for you, and we can finalize the details.

Best,

I appreciate your flexibility and the revised pricing of $40 per person. I’m happy to confirm the catering arrangement for 65 guests with the adjusted menu. Please proceed with the preparations, keeping in mind our need for kosher supervision under the Orthodox Union. I will ensure to send over the final guest count and any specific dietary requests as we get closer to the date. 

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to working together!
