Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your catering needs for the upcoming corporate gala scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event. Our menu can accommodate a variety of preferences, including mixed options, and all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we typically recommend a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, with highlights such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platter, and assorted pastries. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT and can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

Please let us know if you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to include a bar service, which is priced separately. We also offer various accommodations for dietary restrictions upon request.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The menu sounds great, especially the herb-roasted chicken. However, our company budget is a bit tighter than anticipated. Would you be able to adjust the price to $65 per person? Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service includes both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages?  

I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to working together to make this event successful.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. While I cannot lower the price to $65 per person, I can offer the $75 rate with a complimentary soda and juice bar included, which normally costs an additional $10 per person. This way, you can still provide beverages for your guests without exceeding your budget.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your generous offer with the beverage inclusion. I think that works perfectly for us. I would like to confirm the catering for 100 guests at the agreed price of $75 per person, which brings the final total to $7,500.  

Please send over the contract and any further details regarding the setup and cancellation policy. Looking forward to finalizing everything!
