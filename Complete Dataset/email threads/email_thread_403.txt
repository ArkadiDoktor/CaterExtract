Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on December 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this occasion. Our offerings can accommodate a wide range of dietary preferences, and we specialize in a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

For events like yours, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes VAT. We suggest planning for a minimum of 50 guests and can cater up to 150. Our standard package covers setup, staffing, and a selection of dishes such as slow-roasted beef and grilled vegetable platters.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

I appreciate your prompt response. The pricing looks reasonable, but I was hoping to get a clearer idea about the dietary accommodations you mentioned. We will have some guests with specific dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Also, could you confirm if the $45 per person price includes beverages, or are they charged separately? Lastly, we are expecting around 80 guests, so I would like to confirm the final pricing based on that number.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your feedback. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegan options within our menu. As for beverages, the $45 per person does not include them; we can offer a bar package starting at an additional $15 per guest.  

With your current estimate of 80 guests, the total catering cost would come to $3,600, inclusive of VAT. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled two weeks prior to the event.  

Let me know if this works for you or if you have any further questions.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the menu options and pricing. I would like to proceed with the catering for 80 guests at the total cost of $3,600, excluding the bar package. Please confirm that the food will be kosher and under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority, as that is important for our event.  

I will also need to discuss the setup timing and equipment on-site, so please let me know when we can touch base on those details.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best regards,
