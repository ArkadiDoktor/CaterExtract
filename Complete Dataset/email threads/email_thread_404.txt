Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th at the Riverside Convention Center. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to various dietary needs, and I believe we can help make your event exceptional.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, we offer a range of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed selections. Our pricing typically starts at $45 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We use only kosher ingredients under the supervision of the Star-K, and I can assure you that we can accommodate dietary restrictions upon request.  

Please let me know a convenient time for us to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate the kosher certification and the flexibility with dietary accommodations. However, I was hoping to clarify whether the $45 per person includes VAT or if that cost is added on top. Additionally, could you provide an idea of the menu items you typically offer? I'm particularly interested in ensuring a variety of options that cater to different tastes.  

Lastly, we are expecting around 80 guests, but we want to keep the option open to go slightly above or below that number. If we proceed, what are the cancellation terms?  

Looking forward to hearing back.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $45 per person does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. As for the menu, we can offer dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, vegan stuffed peppers, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can also provide a dessert table with a variety of sweet options.  

Regarding your guest count, we can comfortably accommodate between 70 and 100 guests. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least 14 days prior to the event. If you have any further questions or adjustments, please feel free to reach out.
