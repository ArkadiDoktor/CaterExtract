Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th at the Grand Hotel. We would be delighted to assist with your event. Our catering services can provide a mixed menu featuring a selection of meat and dairy options, tailored to suit your guests' preferences.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $75, which includes a range of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and all prices include VAT. Additionally, we can offer kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union to ensure your guests' dietary needs are met.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu items in mind. We can also provide bar services if needed.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the initial proposal. The per-person rate sounds reasonable, but could we explore the possibility of adjusting the price to $65 per person? We expect around 150 guests, so this would help us stay within our budget.  

Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 includes beverages or if they would be an extra cost? We would like to ensure that our guests have a complete dining experience.  

Thanks for your help!  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing. While I can’t go down to $65, I can offer you a final rate of $70 per person for 150 guests, which would total $10,500. This price includes a selection of beverages, but if you’d like an open bar, we can discuss that as an additional option.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu and any additional details.  

Warm regards,
