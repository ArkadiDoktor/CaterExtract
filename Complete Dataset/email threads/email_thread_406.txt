Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to Culinary Delights Catering. We would be thrilled to assist you with your upcoming corporate event scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu tailored to meet the needs of our clients.  

To give you an idea of our offerings, our pricing typically starts at $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests. Please let us know if you have specific dietary requirements or preferences, as we can offer kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Additionally, we do not include a bar service in our base package, but we can provide beverage options if desired. VAT is included in our quoted prices.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The price point of $45 per person sounds reasonable. However, given our budget constraints, would it be possible to negotiate down to $40 per person? We expect around 100 guests, so it would help us significantly.  

Could you also provide more details about the menu? Specifically, we would like to know if there are vegetarian and gluten-free options available, as well as some of the highlighted dishes.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget concerns. I can offer you a reduced rate of $42 per person for your event, which would bring the total to $4,200 for 100 guests. This package would include a mixed menu featuring chicken, beef, and vegetarian options, along with a dessert bar. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free requests as well.  

Please note that we would require a 20% deposit upon confirmation, and our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to two weeks prior to the event. Let me know if this works for you, and I will send over the menu selections.
