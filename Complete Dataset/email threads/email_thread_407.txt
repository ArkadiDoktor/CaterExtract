Our standard catering package includes a diverse range of menu options, featuring both meat and dairy dishes. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and our pricing structure is fixed at $85 per person. This price includes VAT. Additionally, we offer a variety of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

All food will be under strict rabbinical supervision, ensuring that it is fully kosher. However, beverages are not included in this package, but we can provide a separate bar service if desired.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the details you've provided.  

I have a few questions regarding the pricing. Is there any flexibility if we have fewer than 100 guests? Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy? Lastly, we are considering adding a bar service; what would the additional costs be for that?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. For events with fewer than 100 guests, we can still accommodate you, but the minimum charge would remain at $8,500 for the full package. As for the cancellation policy, we require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund.  

Regarding the bar service, we can offer a full bar package starting at $25 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and signature cocktails. I hope this information helps you in your planning.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed or have any other questions.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I would like to proceed with the catering package for 120 guests, including the bar service. This brings our total to $10,200, which I believe is reasonable. Please confirm that the food will be kosher under your mentioned supervision and that the setup will be completed two hours before the event begins.  

Looking forward to finalizing the arrangements.  

Best regards,
