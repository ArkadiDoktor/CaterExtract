Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on April 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We’re excited to help make your special day memorable. 

We offer a range of menu options that can cater to various preferences, including a delicious selection of meat dishes, alongside vegetarian options. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please let us know if you have specific dietary requirements, as we can adjust our menu accordingly.

We also ensure that our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, but please note that a bar service is not included in this price. If you’re interested in adding beverages, we can discuss that further. 

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for the quick response and for the detailed proposal. The price seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate it down a bit since we have a larger guest list in mind. Would you be able to offer a discount if we confirm for 120 guests? 

Also, I wanted to confirm if the $75 price includes VAT or if that is added on top. We are trying to finalize our budget soon.

Thanks for your help!

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. For a confirmed guest list of 120, I can offer a revised price of $70 per person, which will include VAT. That brings the total to $8,400 for the event. 

Rest assured, the menu can still accommodate specific dietary needs, and we will provide a variety of dishes to satisfy all guests. If you want to include a bar service, we can arrange that separately, so just let me know.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Warm regards,

Please proceed with the necessary arrangements, and let me know if you need any further details from my end. I assume the cancellation policy is standard for events of this nature?
