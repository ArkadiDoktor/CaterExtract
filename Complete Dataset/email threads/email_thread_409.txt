Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event. Our offerings include a variety of menu options that can accommodate different dietary preferences.  

We typically charge $45 per person, which includes a selection of main courses, sides, and desserts. Our minimum guest count is 50, and we can cater up to 150 guests. The pricing is inclusive of VAT. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union if required.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $45 per person rate sounds reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if that includes beverages, as we may want to offer a bar for our guests. Also, could you provide more details on the types of dishes you would recommend? We will likely have around 75 guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person pricing does not include a bar service, but we can certainly provide non-alcoholic beverages as part of the meal. For the menu, I recommend a mix of meat and dairy options, including grilled chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of seasonal sides. We can also accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free requests.  

If you decide to go ahead, the total for 75 guests would be $3,375. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to two weeks before the event.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
