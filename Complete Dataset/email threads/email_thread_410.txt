Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding your catering services. I appreciate the menu flexibility you mentioned. However, I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person price includes VAT or if that is an additional charge. Additionally, we are looking for kosher options, so could you confirm if your food is kosher and the supervision involved?  

We are also considering whether to include a bar or beverages in the catering package. I understand that may affect the pricing.  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The quoted price of $75 per person does include VAT. I'm pleased to inform you that we offer a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary laws are followed.  

Regarding the bar, we can provide a separate beverage package starting at an additional $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. If you prefer a full bar service, we can discuss that as well.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed based on this information, and we can finalize the menu options and any additional details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I would like to move forward with the catering for 100 guests at the price of $75 per person, which totals to $7,500. This will include the kosher menu as discussed. I will also arrange for the beverage package, bringing the total to $8,000.  

Please also confirm that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we cancel at least two weeks in advance. Let’s proceed, and I will send over the deposit once I receive your confirmation.  

Best regards,
