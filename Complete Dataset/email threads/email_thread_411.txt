Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Culinary Delights regarding your event on March 15th. We would be thrilled to provide catering services for what I understand is a corporate gala. Our menu options are quite versatile, and I can assure you we have a selection that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

We typically price our services at $50 per person, which includes a three-course meal. For such events, we recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can cater up to 150. Our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision from the local Beth Din, and we can certainly provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific menu items in mind.  

Best regards,  
David Green

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing you mentioned sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify if VAT is included in that figure. Additionally, we are considering including a bar service, so could you provide details on costs associated with beverages?  

We expect around 100 guests, but I would like to keep the option open for a few more if necessary. Also, could you highlight some specific menu items that you would recommend?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $50 per person does not include VAT, which would be added on top. For the bar service, we can offer various packages, starting at an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

As for the menu, I recommend our herb-crusted beef tenderloin, along with a creamy mushroom risotto and a seasonal vegetable medley. We can also accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian requests.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have any further questions.  

Warm regards,
