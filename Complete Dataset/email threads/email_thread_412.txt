Hi Michael, 

I appreciate your prompt response. The menu sounds lovely and the pricing is reasonable. However, I was hoping to clarify if the $65 per person includes everything, or if there are additional costs for any special requests. We are expecting around 120 guests and would like to ensure everything is within our budget. 

Also, could you confirm whether the food is kosher and under what supervision? This is important for us and our families.

Thank you for your assistance.

Warm regards,

Hello Sarah, 

I understand your concerns and I'm happy to clarify. The $65 per person does encompass everything, including setup and staffing, but any special dietary requests would incur an extra charge. As for the kosher status, our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Kashrut Authority, which should align with your needs. 

If you decide to move forward, I can reserve your date and finalize the details with a deposit. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to proceed.

Best,
