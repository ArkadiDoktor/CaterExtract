Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your wedding on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for such a special occasion. We specialize in a mixed menu featuring delectable options for all guests.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which is set at $75. This includes VAT and can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests. We ensure that all our food is kosher, prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

We can also provide a selection of beverages, although the bar service is not included in this price. We can discuss a range of dietary accommodations if needed.  

Please let me know if you have any specific menu items in mind or other preferences, and I’ll be happy to assist you further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The per-person rate sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to get a clearer idea of what that would total for 120 guests. Can you provide some representative menu items as well?  

Additionally, we would like beverages included in the package if possible. We are also considering late-night snacks, so if you could send over an updated proposal with those details, that would be great.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. For 120 guests, the total would come to $9,000, including VAT. As for the menu, we can offer options like herb-marinated chicken, roasted vegetable platter, and a delicious chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Regarding beverages, I can offer a package that includes soft drinks and a selection of wines for an additional $1,200. Late-night snacks can be added as well, featuring mini sliders or gourmet pizzas. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to one month prior to the event date.  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I can prepare a formal agreement.
