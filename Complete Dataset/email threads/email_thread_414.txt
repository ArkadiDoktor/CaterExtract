Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming gala dinner. We would be delighted to assist you with this special event. Our catering service specializes in providing exquisite meals tailored to your needs, and we have a variety of options available.  

For a gala dinner, we recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy dishes, allowing for a diverse selection for your guests. Our pricing is structured at approximately 70 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing for the evening. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

Please note that all our food is kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification. We can also provide a selection of beverages for an additional fee if desired. The event date you mentioned, May 15, aligns perfectly with our availability.

Hi Matthew,  

I appreciate your prompt response and the details you've provided. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but I’m hoping to lower the cost a bit. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to 60 per person? Also, could you clarify whether VAT is included in the pricing you quoted?  

We expect around 80 guests, and I want to ensure that the menu can accommodate vegetarian options as well. Additionally, could you confirm if the bar service is included in the package?  

Thanks,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your budget considerations. I can offer a revised price of 65 per person, which includes VAT. This will still allow us to provide a high-quality mixed menu, featuring dishes like herb-crusted chicken and a selection of gourmet vegetarian options.  

Regarding the bar, it is not included in the base price, but I can provide a package deal if you’re interested. If we proceed, we can finalize the guest count closer to the event date, but we will need a commitment for at least 70 guests to secure the reservation.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward to lock in the details.  

Best,
