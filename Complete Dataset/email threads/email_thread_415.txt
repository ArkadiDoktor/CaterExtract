Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services and would be delighted to support your gathering.  

For your event, we can offer a diverse menu that includes a selection of meat dishes, vegetarian options, and also accommodates specific dietary needs. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that our food is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

We can also provide a full bar service for an additional fee, or we can offer a selection of non-alcoholic beverages included in the base price. I would love to discuss your preferences for menu items and any specific requests you might have.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing per person looks reasonable, but given our budget constraints, we’d like to explore if there’s any flexibility in the price if we increase the guest count. We are expecting around 80 to 100 attendees.  

Additionally, while I appreciate the kosher offerings, could you confirm the specific dishes you have in mind? We are particularly interested in ensuring that there are suitable vegetarian options available.  

Could you also clarify the cancellation policy? It’s always good to have that information upfront.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly adjust the pricing if you secure a larger guest count. If you move forward with 100 guests, I can reduce the price to $40 per person, which would come to a total of $4,000 inclusive of VAT.  

As for the menu, I can suggest a variety including herb-roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a fresh salad bar. We also offer gluten-free options to accommodate dietary restrictions. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and if you’d like to finalize the details, I can send over a formal agreement.
