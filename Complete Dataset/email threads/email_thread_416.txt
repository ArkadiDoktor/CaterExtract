Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding celebration on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your special day. Our menu offers a diverse range of options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under the supervision of the Mashgiach T'zir, ensuring it meets kosher standards.  

We typically charge a fixed price of 75 dollars per person, which includes VAT. This price accommodates a minimum of 50 guests and can cater to a maximum of 150. We can also provide a selection of beverages, but please note that a full bar service is not included in the package.  

If you would like, I can suggest some popular dishes from our menu that have been well received in the past. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions to consider, and feel free to reach out with any questions.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing looks reasonable, but I am wondering if there is any flexibility in the rate, especially for a larger group. We are currently expecting around 120 guests and would also like to explore options for a bar service if possible. Additionally, could you clarify any potential cancellation terms?  

I appreciate your attention to dietary needs, and we will have a few guests who require vegetarian options. Please send over some dish suggestions at your earliest convenience.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need for flexibility. For a party of 120 guests, we could adjust the price to 70 dollars per person, while maintaining the same quality of service and menu. If you choose to include a bar service, I can offer a selection of wines and soft drinks for an additional 15 dollars per person.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made. I will prepare a menu proposal with vegetarian options and popular dishes for your review shortly.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details with you.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised pricing and information on the cancellation policy. I would like to proceed with the adjusted price of 70 dollars per person for 120 guests, and I’m interested in the bar service for an additional 15 dollars per person. This brings the total to 10,200 dollars, which I understand includes VAT.  

Please prepare the final agreement, and I look forward to your menu suggestions, including the vegetarian options. Thank you for your assistance as we finalize our plans.  

Best regards,
