Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming gala on April 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event, which I understand will host between 100 and 150 guests. Our pricing starts at £45 per person for our mixed menu, which includes a selection of meat and vegetarian dishes.  

We take pride in ensuring that all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the London Beth Din. Additionally, we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options. Please note that our prices include VAT.  

If you're interested, I can provide a sample menu and discuss any additional needs you may have, such as staffing or equipment for the event.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Tom,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. I appreciate that you offer kosher meals and dietary accommodations. Could we discuss the possibility of a fixed price for the entire event? Given our guest range, it would help with budgeting. Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are included or if they would be an extra charge?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your need for a fixed price. For your event, we can offer a package at £6,000 for up to 150 guests. This would cover the full menu, which includes a variety of dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of salads. Beverages, including soft drinks and coffee, would be an additional cost, but we can arrange a bar service if you prefer.  

Should you decide to book, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than two weeks before the event. Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further adjustments in mind.  

Warm regards,
