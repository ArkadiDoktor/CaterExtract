Dear Emma,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering options we can provide for your corporate event scheduled for November 15th. At Gourmet Delights, we pride ourselves on offering a diverse menu tailored to meet various dietary needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring there is something for everyone. Our pricing structure is set at $40 per person, with a minimum requirement of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. This price includes all necessary staffing and equipment for setup and service. Please note that VAT is included in this price.  

Additionally, we can accommodate specific dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. If you require kosher meals, we can provide them under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please let me know if you would like to include a bar service, as that would be an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your feedback so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,  
Lucas McKenzie

Hi Lucas,  

Thank you for your prompt response and detailed proposal. I appreciate the flexibility you offer with the menu options, particularly for dietary restrictions. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of points before making a decision.  

Is it possible to negotiate the price per person? Given our budget constraints, we are hoping to stay closer to $35 per person. Additionally, while I appreciate the kosher option, we will not be needing bar service for this event.  

If you could confirm these adjustments, I believe we can move forward quickly.  

Best,  
Emma

Dear Emma,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the budget constraints and can adjust the price to $37 per person while still maintaining the quality of the service and menu. Since we will not include bar service, I believe this is a fair compromise.  

I can also assure you that the kosher meals will be prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and I will ensure that our team is well-informed about the dietary accommodations you require.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi Lucas,  

Thank you for your willingness to adjust the pricing. I am happy to confirm that we will proceed with your catering services at the rate of $37 per person for a total of 80 guests. This brings the final price to $2,960, inclusive of VAT.  

I appreciate the kosher supervision and your attention to dietary needs. We are excited about the event and look forward to working together. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience.  

Warm regards,
