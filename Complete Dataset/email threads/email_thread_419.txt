Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. However, the budget for our event is a bit tighter than anticipated. Would you be able to adjust your pricing to $45 per person? Additionally, we expect around 150 guests, so I would love to confirm the final price if we can agree on this.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Thanks for your response. I understand your budget concerns, and I can offer you a special rate of $47 per person for your event with a minimum of 150 guests. This would bring the total to $7,050, inclusive of VAT. We can provide a lovely selection of dishes, and I can assure you that our team will be well-prepared to handle the setup and service.
