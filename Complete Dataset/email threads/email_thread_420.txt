Dear Sarah,

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing exquisite meals tailored to the specific needs of our clients. For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of savory meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.

Our pricing is structured at $65 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. The package also includes a variety of appetizers, entrees such as herb-roasted chicken and vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of desserts. If you are interested, please let me know if you would also require beverages, as they can be arranged separately.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,

Thanks for your prompt response. The menu sounds delicious, but I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Given the number of guests we anticipate could be closer to 125, would you be open to a fixed price of $60 per person? Also, could we include some beverages in that price, or would they still need to be arranged separately?

Please let me know if this is possible.

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your interest in our services and understand the need to work within a budget. I can offer the fixed price of $60 per person for 125 guests, but beverages will need to be billed separately at $15 per person. The package will still include the menu I previously outlined, and we can ensure all dietary options are accommodated as needed.

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this arrangement.

Warm regards,  
David Thompson

Please send over the contract and any additional details regarding setup and staffing.
