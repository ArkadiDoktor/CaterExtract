Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The pricing you mentioned is certainly within our budget, but I would like to confirm whether that amount includes VAT. Additionally, we are keen on ensuring the food is kosher. Could you clarify the level of supervision for the kosher certification?  

We are also considering a bar service for the reception, so could you please let me know if that is included in your proposal or if it would be an additional cost? We are expecting approximately 150 guests.  

Looking forward to your clarifications.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person price does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final cost. As for the kosher certification, our food is under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council of America, ensuring it meets all kosher requirements.  

Regarding the bar service, we can provide a selection of beverages at an additional cost of $25 per person. This includes wine, beer, and non-alcoholic options. With your estimated guest count, the total would come to $11,250, excluding VAT and the bar service.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed, and if so, I can send over the formal agreement and menu options.  

Best,

Please send over the formal agreement along with a sample menu at your earliest convenience. We are excited to work with you to make this event memorable!
