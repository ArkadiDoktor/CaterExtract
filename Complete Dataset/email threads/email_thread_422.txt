Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed an important occasion for us, and I appreciate the preliminary details you provided. I would like to confirm if your menu options are kosher and what supervision you adhere to. Additionally, would it be possible to adjust the pricing if we finalize for 150 guests instead of 200?  

Also, I wanted to clarify whether beverages are included in your proposal or if that would be an additional cost.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your questions. Yes, we can provide a kosher menu supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary needs are met. For the adjusted guest count of 150, we can offer a final price of $70 per person, still inclusive of VAT.  

Regarding beverages, we typically offer a separate bar package, but we can include a selection of soft drinks and coffee in the catering price if that works for you. Please let me know if you would like to see the detailed bar options.  

Best,
