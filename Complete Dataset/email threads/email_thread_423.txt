Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds promising, and I appreciate the details you've provided. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would you consider a fixed price for 150 guests to make it easier for us to manage? Additionally, it’s crucial for us to ensure that all food is kosher, and I would like to know under what supervision this would be done.  

Also, does your proposal include beverages, or would that be additional? If you could clarify these points, it would help us move forward more quickly.  

Best,  
Rachel

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your feedback. I completely understand the need for a fixed price. For 150 guests, we can offer a package deal of $10,500, which includes a kosher menu under the supervision of the OK Kosher Certification. This price also includes VAT.  

Regarding beverages, our standard package does not include a bar, but we can certainly provide a beverage package for an additional cost. We can accommodate various dietary options, including vegetarian and gluten-free meals.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
