Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to your specific needs. For your event, we can offer a diverse menu that includes a selection of meat and dairy options, ensuring there's something for everyone.  

Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $45 per person, which includes a complete meal service, but excludes beverages. Additionally, we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests. Please note that VAT is included in our pricing.  

We are fully kosher certified under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary requirements are met. We can also provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request.  

I look forward to your feedback on this proposal.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a little on the price, especially since we are expecting around 150 guests. Would you be willing to offer a discount if we commit to more than 100 guests? Also, can you confirm if the menu includes any signature dishes that we should consider highlighting?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in working with us. For a group of 150 guests, I can offer the price at $42 per person, which would bring the total to $6,300. The menu features some of our signature dishes, including herb-crusted chicken and a delightful quinoa salad.  

Regarding drinks, we can provide a beverage package for an additional cost if that interests you. Please let me know your thoughts, and I can also provide options for setup and staffing as needed.  

Best,
