Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Michael Rosen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you're organizing a corporate gala on November 15, and I would love to assist with your catering needs. 

We specialize in a diverse menu that includes both meat and dairy options, and we can accommodate various dietary restrictions. Our pricing generally starts at $45 per person, which includes setup and service staff. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. I can provide a detailed menu that includes some of our signature dishes such as herb-crusted salmon and a delightful vegetarian lasagna.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further or if you have specific requirements in mind.

Best regards,  
Michael Rosen

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I am hoping to keep the budget under $40 per person. Additionally, can you confirm whether the food will be kosher? We have several attendees who require it. If so, what supervision do you have in place? 

Also, are beverages included in that price, or will they be an additional charge? I would appreciate any further details on the menu options and accommodations for dietary restrictions.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your feedback. I can adjust the menu to bring the price down to $40 per person while still offering a variety of options. Our food is kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification, ensuring it meets the highest standards. 

Regarding beverages, we typically charge separately for bar services, but I can offer a package that includes soft drinks and coffee for an additional $5 per person. I can send over a sample menu that reflects these adjustments, including options for dietary needs such as gluten-free and vegan dishes.

Please let me know if this works for you.

Best,

Hi Michael,

I appreciate your flexibility with the menu and the confirmation regarding kosher supervision. The adjusted price of $40 per person works for us, and I would like to proceed with the package that includes soft drinks and coffee. 

Could you please send me the final menu and confirm that setup will be complete by 5 PM on the day of the event? Also, can you outline your cancellation policy? 

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to finalizing the details.
