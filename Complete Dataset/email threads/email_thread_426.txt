We offer a range of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Our pricing typically ranges from $45 to $75 per person, depending on the selected menu and guest count.  

Please let me know how many guests you are expecting, as we can accommodate between 50 to 150 attendees. Additionally, we can provide a full beverage bar, which can be tailored to your preferences. I would be happy to discuss dietary accommodations as well.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the information you've provided. We're planning for about 100 guests, and I like the idea of a kosher menu. However, I was hoping to keep the budget a bit lower. Is there any flexibility in your pricing? Perhaps if we could settle around $50 per person, I would feel more comfortable.  

Also, could you clarify if the pricing includes VAT? Lastly, I’m interested in seeing a sample menu to get a better idea of the dishes you offer.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for getting back to me. I can certainly work with your budget of $50 per person for a guest count of 100. The final price would then be $5,000, and this includes VAT. I can send over a sample menu shortly, which will feature a variety of dishes, including beef brisket, roasted vegetables, and traditional kugel.  

We also provide staff for setup and serving, and we can accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let me know if there are any specific needs. As for the cancellation policy, we typically require a two-week notice for a full refund.  

Looking forward to your thoughts!
