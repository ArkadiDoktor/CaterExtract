Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the catering options for your upcoming charity gala scheduled for October 15th. We specialize in catering events like yours and would be thrilled to provide our services.  

Our standard pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal, staff, and necessary equipment. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250. Our menu features a mixed selection of dishes, including options for various dietary needs. I can assure you that all food is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Additionally, we can offer a selection of beverages, but please note that a bar service would be an added expense. VAT is included in our pricing.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The price per person is reasonable, but given our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a slightly lower rate? We are expecting around 150 guests, and while the mixed menu sounds great, I would appreciate any suggestions for lighter options as well since some guests may prefer those.  

Could you also clarify if the bar service could be offered at a flat rate or if it would vary based on selections? Let’s aim to finalize this soon as we want to ensure everything is set for the gala.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. I can reduce the price to $70 per person if we confirm the booking by the end of this week. Regarding the bar service, we can provide a fixed rate based on a selection of wines and beers, which we can discuss further to fit your needs.  

For the lighter menu options, I can include a few dishes like roasted vegetable platters and fish fillets alongside the main courses. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer.  

Best,
