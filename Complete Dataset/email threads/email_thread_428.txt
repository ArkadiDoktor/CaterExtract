Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special event. Our offerings include a diverse menu with options for meat, dairy, and mixed dishes, ensuring there's something for everyone. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian options.  

We typically charge $75 per person, which includes VAT, and we require a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150 guests. Beverages are not included in this pricing but can be arranged if desired. If you decide to proceed, we would need a 30% deposit to secure the date, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least one month prior to the event.  

I look forward to discussing this further. Please let me know if you have any specific menu items in mind or if you would like to see some of our popular dishes.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss the per person cost a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a slightly lower rate if we commit to 100 guests? Additionally, could you provide examples of your popular menu items? We are especially interested in options that would appeal to a diverse crowd.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your position and appreciate you bringing it up. For a commitment of 100 guests, I can reduce the cost to $70 per person, which still includes VAT. As for the menu, some of our popular items include herb-marinated grilled chicken, roasted vegetable medley, and a selection of desserts like chocolate mousse and fruit tarts. We can also tailor the menu based on your guests' preferences.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any other adjustments you would like to discuss.
