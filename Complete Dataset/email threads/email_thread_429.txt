Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to clarify the inclusion of beverages; are they part of the package or would they be an additional cost? Also, could you provide some examples of the dishes included in the fixed price?  

If possible, we might have a maximum of 120 guests, so I would like to know if we can finalize the arrangement with that in mind.  

Best,

Hi Emily,  

I appreciate your quick reply. The beverage options are priced separately. We can offer a variety of drinks, including soft beverages and a selection of wines. As for the menu, we typically include dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a seasonal salad.  

If you finalize with 120 guests, the total would come to $5,400, including VAT. We also have a flexible cancellation policy, allowing cancellations up to 14 days before the event. Let me know if this works for you!
