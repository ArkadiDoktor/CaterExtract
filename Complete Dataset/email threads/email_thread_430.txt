Dear Sarah, 

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 10th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our catering services include a wide variety of options, and we typically offer a mixed menu that can cater to both vegetarian and meat preferences. 

For pricing, we generally charge $45 per person. This includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. I would also like to mention that all our food is under kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets your dietary needs. 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu options further or if you have any particular requests.

Email 2 – Event Organizer:
Hi Michael, 

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but we are hoping to keep our budget closer to $40 per person. Can you let me know if there’s any flexibility on that rate? Additionally, we would like to include a bar service for the evening. Would that be feasible within the adjusted price? 

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best,

Hi Sarah, 

I appreciate your feedback. Given your budget, I can offer a special rate of $42 per person, which will include a selection of wine and beer for the bar service. We can still provide our kosher menu under the Orthodox Union supervision, and I assure you it will include some crowd-pleasing dishes like grilled salmon and roasted vegetable platters. 

Please note that we have a cancellation policy of 48 hours before the event, and I can hold this pricing for you for a few days while you consider it.

Best,
