Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. We specialize in a variety of menus, including kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary needs are met.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and can serve up to 300. The menu can include a selection of meat dishes, salads, and desserts. However, if you are interested in beverages or a bar service, we can discuss that as well, as it would be an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you have specific dietary accommodations in mind or if you would like to discuss menu highlights further.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The corporate gala sounds like a great opportunity for us, and I appreciate the details you provided. I would like to confirm that we will have around 250 guests, and I am particularly interested in the meat menu options you mentioned.  

Regarding beverages, could you provide more information on the bar service, including what types of drinks you offer and the pricing? Additionally, we may need to accommodate a few dietary restrictions. Are you able to provide vegetarian options alongside the meat dishes?  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear about the number of guests. For the bar service, we typically offer a range of wines, beers, and signature cocktails at an additional cost of $15 per person. As for the dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian options, ensuring that all guests have suitable meals.  

If we proceed with the current pricing of $50 per person for 250 guests, the total would come to $12,500, which includes VAT. We understand that flexibility is crucial, so if you need to adjust the number of guests, we can accommodate a range between 200 and 300 without any issues.  

Please let me know if this works for your budget and if you would like to finalize the details.
