Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights Catering regarding your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to various occasions, and I would love to discuss how we can support your needs.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, which we believe would appeal to your guests. Our pricing is structured at $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

I would also like to mention that our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary requirements are met. However, our package does not include a bar or beverage service; we can provide that separately if you wish.  

Please let me know a convenient time for us to discuss this further and finalize the details.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Grayson

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of points.  

Is there any flexibility in the pricing if we reach closer to the maximum guest count? Additionally, could you provide some examples of the menu items you typically serve? We are considering dietary accommodations for gluten-free options as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. I can certainly offer a reduced rate of $45 per person if we exceed 100 guests. As for the menu, we typically feature dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads. We can also provide gluten-free options to accommodate your guests' needs.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement. Just a reminder that our cancellation policy requires a notice of two weeks prior to the event.
