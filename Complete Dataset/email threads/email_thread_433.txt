Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this occasion. Our menu options include a variety of meat, dairy, and mixed dishes, which can be tailored to meet your needs.  

For a gathering of 50 to 150 guests, we typically charge between 30 to 50 dollars per person, depending on the menu selections. All of our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, specifically by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards.  

We can also provide a selection of beverages, but please note that a full bar is not included in our standard package. We are happy to accommodate dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options.  

If you could provide more details about your preferences and any specific requirements, we can finalize the proposal and send over a detailed quote.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the information on your menu and pricing. We are expecting around 100 guests, and I prefer a mixed menu that includes some vegetarian options as well.  

I would like to clarify the pricing. If we proceed with a package for 100 guests, what would the total cost be, and does that include VAT? Additionally, could you confirm the cancellation policy in case anything changes?  

I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. For 100 guests, the total would be 4,500 dollars, which includes VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if you notify us at least two weeks before the event date.  

With the mixed menu, we can offer dishes like grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of salads. We are also able to provide a basic beverage package that includes soft drinks and water. If you decide to include a full bar, we can discuss options separately.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if you have any further questions.  

Best,
