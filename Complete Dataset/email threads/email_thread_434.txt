Dear Emily,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to express my interest in providing catering services for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. At Gourmet Delights, we specialize in offering a range of menu options tailored to various dietary requirements, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. 

For this event, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing structure is flexible, with a fixed rate of $75 per person for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. This price includes VAT, and we can also provide a selection of beverages at an additional cost. 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requirements.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a few details. While the menu sounds great, could you provide more information on the specific dishes included? Additionally, we may have around 120 guests, so I wanted to confirm if that fits within your offerings. 

Also, can you accommodate any dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free or vegetarian options? We are also interested in knowing about your cancellation policy, just in case our plans change.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your questions. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian requests, ensuring that everyone has enjoyable options at the gala. Our menu will feature dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. 

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require at least two weeks' notice for any cancellations to avoid charges. For your estimated guest count of 120, I can offer a total price of $9,000, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. The final price remains inclusive of VAT. 

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Warm regards,
