Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Mark Levinson, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand that you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to assist you in providing a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

We specialize in a variety of menus, including kosher options, and can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can offer a mixed menu with both meat and dairy options, and we also provide vegetarian and gluten-free alternatives upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further. I can provide additional details or customize the menu to fit your needs.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm excited about the possibilities for our gala. The price per person seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few details. Is the $75 price inclusive of VAT, or will that be added on top? Also, can you confirm whether the kosher meals are supervised, and if so, by which authority?  

Additionally, we are considering having a bar service. Is that included in your proposal, or would that be an extra charge? I look forward to clarifying these points so we can move forward.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person price does include VAT. Our kosher meals are under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary laws are strictly followed.  

As for the bar service, we can provide a full bar at an additional cost of $20 per person. This includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. If you prefer, we can also arrange a separate beverage station with non-alcoholic options.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and if you have any more questions or if you would like to proceed with the booking.  

Best,
