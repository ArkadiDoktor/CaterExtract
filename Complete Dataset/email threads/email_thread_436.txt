Hi David,  

Thank you for your detailed proposal. I appreciate the flexibility with the menu options and dietary accommodations. Before we proceed, could you clarify whether the food is kosher and, if so, what supervision you follow? Additionally, I would like to confirm if beverages are included in the package or if they will be an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. Our food is indeed kosher, under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council of America. However, beverages are not included in the initial price. We can provide a bar service at an additional cost of $15 per person, should you wish to include that.  

Please let me know if you would like to adjust the guest count or menu selections, as we are committed to making your event a success.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications regarding the kosher supervision and beverage options. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests, which brings the total to $7,500, including VAT but excluding the bar service. We would also like to confirm that we can cancel the agreement with a full refund up to two weeks before the event if necessary.  

Please let me know if everything looks good on your end, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
