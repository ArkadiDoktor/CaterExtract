Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on your inquiry regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on October 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food and service for events like yours, and I would be delighted to assist.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, I can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority, ensuring all dietary requirements are met.  

In addition to the food, we can arrange for a beverage service, including wine and soft drinks, for an additional cost. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to confirm that we expect around 120 guests, and I'm glad to hear about the kosher options you offer. However, could we possibly negotiate the price? Our budget is a bit tighter, and I was hoping to get the price down to $40 per person.  

Additionally, can you clarify if the beverage service is included in the $45 price, or would that be separate? Also, I’d like to know about the cancellation terms in case we need to make adjustments closer to the date.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for getting back to me. I understand your budget concerns and can offer the price of $40 per person for a minimum of 100 guests. The beverage service would be an additional $10 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

As for cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.
