Dear Alice,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for April 15. At Gourmet Delights, we specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to suit various events.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically recommend a mixed menu that can cater to diverse dietary needs. Our pricing structure is set at eighty-five dollars per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between fifty to one hundred guests comfortably, and our prices include VAT.  

Additionally, all our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet the highest standards. We can also provide a separate beverage bar upon request, although it is not included in the initial pricing.  

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a time to discuss this further or if you need any specific dietary accommodations.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response and for providing the catering details. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I’d like to clarify if the eighty-five dollars per person includes any specific menu items or just a general selection.  

Additionally, we may have around seventy guests, so can you confirm if there is any flexibility in pricing if we finalize the number? We are considering a beverage bar, but I’d like to know the extra cost for that as well.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Alice,  

I appreciate your interest and inquiries. The eighty-five dollars per person covers our standard menu, which includes options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and assorted desserts. If you're looking for a tailored menu, we can certainly discuss that, which may adjust the pricing.  

For a group of seventy, I can offer a discount, bringing the price down to eighty dollars per person. As for the beverage bar, that would be an additional fifteen dollars per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and non-alcoholic options.  

If you decide to move forward, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks in advance. Please let me know if that works for you.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification and for the discount offer. I would like to confirm the catering for seventy guests at the price of eighty dollars per person, which brings us to a total of five thousand six hundred dollars for the food. I will also include the beverage bar, making it an additional one thousand fifty dollars.  

This brings the total to six thousand six hundred fifty dollars with VAT included. Please proceed with the arrangements, and let me know if you need a deposit or any further details on the setup.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best regards,
