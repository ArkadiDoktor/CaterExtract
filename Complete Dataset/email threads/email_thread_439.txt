Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the tempting menu options. I appreciate the pricing details, but I was hoping to negotiate a fixed price for the entire event rather than a per-person rate, especially since we are expecting around 75 guests. Would you be open to discussing a total package deal? Also, could you confirm whether the food is kosher and if you have any bar services available?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing structure. For a fixed price, I can offer a total of $3,000 for 75 guests, which includes all food options and service staff. The food we provide is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can include a limited bar service for an additional $500.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further adjustments in mind.  

Warm regards,  
Jonathan Reed
