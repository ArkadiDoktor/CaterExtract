Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services.  

For such an event, we offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which is set at $75 per guest. This includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and I can assure you that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

Please note that beverages, including soft drinks and coffee, are not included in the price but can be arranged separately. Additionally, our standard terms allow for a cancellation up to one week before the event.  

Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or specific requests, and I will be happy to customize the menu accordingly. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The per-person rate seems reasonable, but could you confirm whether VAT is included in that price? Additionally, we might have around 125 guests, so I’d like to ensure we can manage within that number.  

I appreciate the kosher certification, but if possible, I would like to see a sample menu to understand the offerings better. It would also be helpful to know if you can accommodate any vegan or gluten-free options, as a few of our attendees have specific dietary needs.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. The $75 per person rate does not include VAT, which will be added as applicable. I can certainly provide you with a sample menu that includes options for vegan and gluten-free diets.  

For your group size of 125, I can confirm that we can accommodate that within the range specified. I will also include some highlights like our herb-roasted chicken and a selection of seasonal salads in the menu.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any other details or adjustments.  

Best,

Thank you for the details. I appreciate your flexibility in accommodating our dietary needs. After reviewing everything, I would like to move forward with the catering service for 125 guests at the total price of $9,375, which includes VAT. Please proceed with the arrangements.  

Could you also confirm the setup timing and staffing details? I want to ensure everything is in place ahead of the event.  

Thank you for your assistance.
