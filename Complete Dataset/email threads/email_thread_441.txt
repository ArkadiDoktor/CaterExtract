Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Maple Catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to suit various dietary needs. Based on your expected attendance of around 50 to 100 guests, I would like to propose a mixed menu featuring both vegetarian and meat options.  

Our pricing is structured at £45 per person, which includes a three-course meal with options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. Additionally, we can accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options, upon request.  

Please note that our pricing does not include VAT, which is charged at the standard rate. We can also discuss beverage options separately if you’re interested in a bar service.  

Let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any questions.  

Best regards,  
James Thompson

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu you suggested sounds great, but I wanted to clarify a couple of things. Firstly, if we decide to have a bar service, what would the additional cost look like? Secondly, we are expecting around 75 guests, so I’d like to know if the price per person remains the same for that number.  

Also, could you confirm if the food will be prepared in a kosher kitchen and what supervision you have in place?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For the bar service, we typically charge an additional £15 per person, which covers a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. If you confirm 75 guests, the total would still be £45 per person, as that rate applies to your expected range of attendees.  

I can confirm that all our food is kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din, and we ensure all preparations meet the necessary standards.  

Regarding your event, we are happy to accommodate any specific dietary requests you may have. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I can also provide details about our cancellation policy, which allows for a full refund up to a week before the event.  

Best,

Hi James,  

Thank you for clarifying everything. I would like to proceed with your proposal for 75 guests, including the bar service, bringing the total to £4,500. Please confirm that this includes VAT, as we’re accounting for that in our budget. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu options and dietary accommodations. 

Once I receive your confirmation, I’ll send over the deposit to secure the booking.
