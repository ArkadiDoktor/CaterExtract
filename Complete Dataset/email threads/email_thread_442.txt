Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services for a variety of events. For your gala, we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring a variety of choices for your guests.  

Our pricing is structured at $65 per person, which includes everything from setup to cleanup. This price covers a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Additionally, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please note that our bar services will be provided separately, should you require them.  

I would be happy to discuss the menu in more detail and provide some highlights like our grilled salmon and roasted vegetable platter. If you're interested, I can also accommodate various dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds delightful, especially the grilled salmon. However, I am looking for a more competitive price point since we have a budget constraint. Would you be able to offer a lower rate, perhaps around $55 per person? Additionally, could you confirm if VAT is included in that pricing?  

I appreciate your willingness to accommodate dietary restrictions, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of staying within budget. I can adjust the price to $60 per person, which includes VAT. This still allows us to provide the quality service and food that we pride ourselves on.  

We can maintain the same menu, and I assure you we will be able to accommodate any dietary needs your guests may have. Please let me know if this new pricing works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for adjusting the price. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to move forward with your proposal at $60 per person, which includes VAT for a total of 60 guests. Please confirm that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we notify you at least two weeks in advance.  

Once I have that confirmed, I will send over the deposit and finalize our menu selection. Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to working together.  

Best regards,
