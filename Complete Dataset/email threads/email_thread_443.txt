Dear Julia,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on June 15th. We have extensive experience in providing high-quality food services for events like yours.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT, and we can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests.  

In addition to the food, we can provide a selection of beverages, including soft drinks and juices, however, a full bar service would be an additional cost. Please let me know your preferences, and I would be happy to draft a preliminary menu for your review.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The price per person seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few details. Can you provide more information on the menu items you typically offer? Additionally, could you confirm if you can accommodate any dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free options?  

We are also considering a full bar for the event, so I would appreciate a separate quote for that service. If we decide to proceed, what are your cancellation terms?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Julia,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Our menu typically includes highlights such as grilled salmon, stuffed chicken, and a variety of vegetarian dishes. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free options, as well as other dietary needs, with advance notice.  

For the full bar service, I can provide a package starting at an additional $25 per person. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund.  

If you decide to move forward with our services, the final price would be $75 per person for the food and $25 for the bar, making it $100 per person total. Please let me know if this works for your budget.
