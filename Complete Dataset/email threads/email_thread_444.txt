Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special occasion. Our catering services can accommodate a range of dietary requirements, and we offer a menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

For a wedding, we typically suggest a minimum of 50 guests and can cater for up to 150. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes full meal service, setup, and staffing. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

We also offer kosher options under the supervision of the ORB, and our menu can feature items such as roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a delightful array of seasonal vegetables.  

If you would like to discuss this further, please let me know.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound great, and I appreciate the detail you've provided. However, I was hoping to clarify a few points. Given that we are expecting around 80 guests, would there be a possibility to adjust the per-person price if we finalize the deal soon? Additionally, could you confirm if drinks are included in that price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in working with us. For your event with 80 guests, I can offer a revised price of $70 per person if we move forward quickly. Unfortunately, the beverages are not included in that price, but I can provide a separate beverage package if you are interested.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a more detailed proposal including the beverage options.  

Best,
