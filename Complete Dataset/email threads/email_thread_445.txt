Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed information regarding the menu and pricing. I would like to confirm that we will have around 150 guests attending the gala. Could you please clarify if your pricing includes beverages or if they are separate? Also, is there any flexibility in the price per person if we reach a higher number of attendees?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The price of $75 per person does not include beverages, but we can arrange a bar package starting at $30 per person if that interests you. If your guest count reaches over 175, we can reduce the price to $70 per person for the additional attendees as a thank you for your business.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.  

Best regards,
