Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for December 10th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I believe we can offer a menu that will delight your guests.  

For this event, we can cater up to 150 attendees, with a pricing structure of $45 per person, which includes VAT. Our menu is diverse and can be tailored to your preferences, featuring a selection of meat and dairy options. We also ensure that all our meat is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or if you have any dietary restrictions we should consider. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a few points. We are expecting a minimum of 100 guests, and if the numbers go beyond that, we could have as many as 130. Could you confirm if there’s flexibility in the price per person if we exceed the minimum?  

Also, I’d appreciate it if you could provide some examples of the dishes included in the menu. We are particularly interested in ensuring there are vegan options available alongside the meat and dairy.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly confirm that the price remains fixed at $45 per person for up to 150 guests. If your numbers exceed that, we could offer a discount of $40 for each additional guest.  

As for the menu, I would suggest a few highlights such as roasted chicken with garlic and herbs, a creamy vegetarian pasta, and a fresh seasonal salad. We can also include options for vegan guests, such as a quinoa and roasted vegetable dish.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the clarification and the menu suggestions. Everything sounds wonderful, and I believe we can proceed with your catering service for 130 guests, which brings the total to $5,200. I will send over a formal agreement shortly. 

Just to confirm, we will need setup assistance, as well as any necessary equipment for serving. Please include this in the final proposal.  

Looking forward to working together!
