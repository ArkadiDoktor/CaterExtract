Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We have experience in catering similar events and can offer a variety of menu options to suit your needs.  

We recommend a buffet-style service featuring a mixed menu, including meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes all necessary setup and service staff. For a minimum of 50 guests, we can accommodate up to 150 guests. Please note that our prices exclude VAT, which will be added on top.  

Additionally, we can ensure that the food is kosher and will be under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. If you would like to include a bar service, we can discuss that as well, as it would be an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you would like to go over the menu options in more detail or if you have any special dietary requirements.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss the per-person rate a bit further. Given our budget constraints, could we explore the possibility of lowering the price to $40 per person? Additionally, I’d like to confirm if you can accommodate 75 guests with some vegetarian options as well.  

Could you also clarify if the $45 per person includes all necessary beverages, or is that an additional charge? I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand the need to stay within budget, and I can offer a reduced rate of $42 per person for a minimum of 75 guests. This price includes the setup and staff, but beverages will need to be added separately, as we generally offer a range of drink options at an additional cost.  

We can certainly accommodate vegetarian options, and our team will ensure that dietary restrictions are addressed. Please let me know if this revised offer works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Warm regards,
