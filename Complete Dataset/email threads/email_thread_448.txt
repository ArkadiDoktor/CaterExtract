Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing to provide you with a proposal for catering your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and can offer a diverse menu tailored to your preferences.  

For your event, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and the price includes VAT.  

All our food is kosher, supervised by the Star-K, and we are happy to accommodate dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options. However, please note that bar services would be an additional cost.  

If you would like to discuss this further or have any specific requests, feel free to reach out.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to explore a few adjustments. We are planning for around 130 guests and would like to ensure that the final price includes everything, including the bar. Can you provide a revised estimate if we decide to go with the bar package?  

Additionally, could you send over some representative menu items to help us envision the meal?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your quick response. For a package that includes the bar, I can adjust the pricing to $95 per person, which would cover drinks and the full meal. This new price would also remain within your guest range.  

As for the menu, we can offer options like smoked brisket, herb-crusted salmon, roasted seasonal vegetables, and a variety of desserts including chocolate mousse and fruit tarts. If you have any specific preferences or additional dietary needs, please let me know.  

I appreciate your consideration, and I look forward to finalizing the details.
