Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m excited to discuss catering options for your upcoming gala scheduled for November 15th. At Gourmet Delights, we specialize in a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs. We offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, and all our ingredients are sourced locally.  

For your event, we can provide a range of services, including setup, staffing, and equipment if needed. Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Additionally, we can offer kosher options under the supervision of the local Rabbinical council.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu items in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a fixed price for the total catering service to simplify things for our budgeting. Would you be able to provide a flat rate for 100 guests? I would also like to confirm whether beverages are included in that price or if they are separate. Additionally, it would be great to know more about the specific kosher options available.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need for clarity in budgeting. For a fixed price catering service for 100 guests, I can offer a total of $4,500, which includes VAT. This package would cover a selection of our mixed menu items, including roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a variety of salads. However, beverages would be an addition to this price.  

As for the kosher options, we can provide a full kosher menu under the supervision of the local Rabbinical council, ensuring all dietary laws are met. Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further requests.  

Best,

Hi David,  

I appreciate your quick adjustments and the clarity regarding the pricing. The flat rate of $4,500 works for us, and I’m pleased to confirm the order for 100 guests with the kosher menu. I will ensure to handle the bar separately. Please send over the contract and any cancellation terms at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything.  

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to a successful event.  

Best regards,
