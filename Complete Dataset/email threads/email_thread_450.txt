Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to confirm that we will have around 150 guests, but we may need to adjust that number slightly as we finalize the guest list. 

Could you clarify what specific dishes would be included in the mixed menu? I am particularly interested in ensuring that there are ample vegetarian options. Additionally, can you provide the cost for including a bar service? If we decide to go ahead, what are your cancellation terms? 

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to provide more details. For the mixed menu, we typically offer options such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of seasonal salads. We can certainly ensure there are a variety of vegetarian options to suit your guests. 

The bar service can be added for an additional $25 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. As for the cancellation policy, we require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund on any deposits made. 

If you’re ready to proceed, I can finalize the total cost for 150 guests at $75 per person, plus the bar service if you choose to include it. Please let me know how you would like to move forward.
