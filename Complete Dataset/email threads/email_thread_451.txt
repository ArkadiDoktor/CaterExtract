We offer a diverse menu tailored to your needs, and I can assure you that all our offerings can be made kosher under the supervision of Rabbi Cohen.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. The bar mitzvah will indeed be a significant event for our family, and I appreciate your offer. However, I was hoping to explore options that might fit our budget a little better. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $60 per person?  

Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 includes beverages, or would that be an additional cost? We typically expect around 75 guests, but the final count could vary slightly.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply and for sharing your budget considerations. I can offer a revised rate of $70 per person, which still includes VAT. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in that price, but I can provide a bar package that starts at an additional $15 per person, featuring a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

If you decide to proceed with the menu at $70, I can assure you that we will provide a delightful selection including grilled chicken, vegetarian pasta, and a variety of salads. Please let me know if this works for you, or if there are further adjustments you'd like to discuss.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for adjusting the pricing. I am happy to accept the offer of $70 per person for 75 guests, which brings the total to $5,250. I would like to include the bar package as well, so that will add $1,125 to the final amount. I appreciate your menu suggestions, and I’m glad to hear that you can accommodate our kosher requirements.  

Can you please confirm the setup timing and whether you will provide staff at the event? I would like to finalize the agreement as soon as possible to ensure everything is in place for March 15.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,
