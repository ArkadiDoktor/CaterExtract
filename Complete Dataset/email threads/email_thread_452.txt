Hi David,  

Thank you for your email. The gala dinner is indeed a significant occasion for us, and I appreciate your prompt response. I am particularly interested in your kosher options and would like to confirm if the pricing you mentioned includes VAT.  

Also, could you provide a sample menu with some highlights? We are considering approximately 100 guests, and I want to ensure we can accommodate various dietary needs. Would you be able to include beverages in the package?  

Looking forward to your reply.

Regarding beverages, we can include a bar package for an additional $1,200, or you can choose to have a cash bar. We can certainly accommodate various dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options.
