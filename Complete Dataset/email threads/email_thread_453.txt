Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Bites regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our general menu is versatile, offering a range of mixed cuisine options, including both meat and dairy dishes, and we are well-equipped to accommodate various dietary needs.  

For our services, we typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and equipment. Our pricing is inclusive of VAT, and we can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests. Please note that we do offer kosher options, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification, if that is something you require.  

We can also provide a selection of beverages as part of the package, but if you prefer to have a full bar setup, we can discuss that as well. I look forward to your response so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the options you provided. We are planning for around 100 guests, and I am indeed interested in the kosher menu. Could you let me know if there is a possibility to adjust the menu to include more vegetarian selections? Additionally, would you be able to confirm if the $75 per person includes the beverages, or would that be an extra cost?  

Also, I would like to clarify the cancellation policy in case plans change. I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. We are happy to adjust the menu to include a wider selection of vegetarian dishes, ensuring that all dietary options are met. The $75 per person does not include a full bar setup; however, we can provide soft drinks and juices at no extra cost. If you would like a bar service, we can discuss additional pricing for that.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund. Should you need to cancel within that timeframe, a 50% charge will apply. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement so we can secure your date.  

Best,

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I would like to proceed with your catering services for 100 guests at the price of $75 per person, including the vegetarian options. We will forgo the full bar service for this event but would like the included beverages. I understand the cancellation policy and agree to the terms.  

Please send over the agreement at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything.
