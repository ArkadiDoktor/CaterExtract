Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event scheduled on November 15th. We specialize in a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing structure is based on a fixed rate of $45 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. We can cater for a minimum of 30 guests and a maximum of 100. Additionally, our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please let us know if you would like to include a bar service, as that would be an additional cost.  

Looking forward to discussing this further with you.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a couple of details. We are expecting around 75 guests, and I would like to confirm that the $45 per person includes VAT. Additionally, could you please provide examples of menu items? I am particularly interested in any meat options you offer.  

Could you also let me know your cancellation policy? I appreciate your help.  

Best,  
Jessica

Dear Jessica,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, the quoted price of $45 per person does include VAT. For the menu, we can offer options such as grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, beef brisket, and a variety of salads.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require at least 14 days' notice before the event for a full refund. If you need to cancel within that timeframe, we can offer a 50% refund. Please let me know if you have any more questions or if you would like to proceed with the booking.  

Best wishes,  
Mark
