Hello Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting around 75 guests for the retreat, and I would like to ensure that the food is kosher. Could you confirm if your meals are certified kosher and the supervision details?  

I would also appreciate it if you could provide a sample menu including some highlights of the dishes, especially any vegetarian options. Regarding beverages, we are interested in a full bar for the evening, so let me know if that can be included in the final price.  

Lastly, can you clarify if your prices include VAT or if it’s added on top?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. I can confirm that all our meals are kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards of compliance.  

For the menu, we can offer options like grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, quinoa salad, and a vegan pasta dish. Our full bar package includes a selection of wines, beers, and cocktails, which can be added for an additional $20 per person. The base price of $65 per person does include VAT.  

With your guest count of 75, the total would come to $4,875 for the food package and $1,500 for the bar, totaling $6,375. As for cancellation, we have a policy that allows for a full refund if canceled 14 days prior to the event.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best wishes,
