Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic. I wanted to clarify if the pricing includes beverages or if that would be an additional cost. Also, could you confirm whether the food is kosher and under what supervision?  

We are expecting around 125 guests, but I want to ensure we have flexibility if the numbers fluctuate.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The quoted price does not include a bar or beverages, but we can provide a package for drinks at an additional cost. As for the kosher requirements, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

If you're firm on the guest count of 125, we can finalize the total at $6,250, which is still within your budget. Additionally, we have a cancellation policy that allows for changes up to two weeks before the event without penalty.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
