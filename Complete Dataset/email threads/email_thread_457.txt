Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services. We specialize in mixed cuisine options and can certainly accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing is typically structured at £50 per person, which includes a full buffet service featuring a selection of dishes such as roasted chicken, quinoa salad, and seasonal vegetables. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that VAT is included in this price.  

Additionally, our offerings can be kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din, should that be a requirement for your event. Unfortunately, beverage service is not included in this price, but we can discuss options for a bar service if desired.  

Let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any questions.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a few points. We are considering a guest list of around 100, but we might go up to 120 depending on final RSVPs.  

Could you confirm if the £50 per person covers all the setup and staffing requirements? I am also curious if you have any specific vegetarian dishes on the menu, as we want to ensure there are sufficient options for all attendees.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,  
Samantha

Hi Samantha,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The £50 per person does include setup and staffing for the event, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. In terms of vegetarian options, we can provide dishes such as stuffed bell peppers, a vibrant pasta primavera, and a selection of fresh salads.  

If your final guest count is confirmed at 120, the total cost would be £6,000, which includes all services and VAT. Please let me know if this works for you, and if you would like to discuss the bar options further.  

Best,

Please also prepare for the bar service; I will send you a separate email regarding that. I understand the cancellation policy is standard, with a notice of 14 days required. If everything is in order, please send over the contract.
