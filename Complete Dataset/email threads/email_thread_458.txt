Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights. We are excited about the opportunity to cater your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in a variety of menu options, including mixed cuisine that can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can offer dishes like roasted chicken with herbs, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet desserts. Please note that VAT will be added on top of the quoted price.  

Additionally, we can provide staff for setup and service, ensuring everything runs smoothly. If you would prefer a bar service, we can discuss options separately.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds delicious, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points. We are expecting around 80 guests and would like to confirm that the food is kosher. Can you tell me more about your supervision?  

Also, the price per person seems a bit high for our budget. Would you be open to negotiating it down to $40 per person? That would really help us meet our budget constraints.  

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your response and your interest in our catering services. I’m happy to confirm that all our food is indeed kosher, supervised under the Orthodox Union.  

Regarding the pricing, I understand the budget considerations. While my initial quote was $45 per person, I can offer a special rate of $42 per person for your group of 80 guests if you confirm by the end of this week. This price includes setup and service but does not cover bar service, which we can arrange separately if needed.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification and your willingness to negotiate. The updated price of $42 per person sounds fair, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details. I would like to move forward with the catering for 80 guests at that price, totaling $3,360.  

Please confirm that this includes everything we discussed, with VAT added, and let me know your cancellation policy. I look forward to working with you on this event.  

Best regards,
