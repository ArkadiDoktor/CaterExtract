Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming bar mitzvah on the 15th of December. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at $65 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. I want to assure you that all of our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets the highest standards.  

For this event, we offer a diverse menu that includes a variety of meat dishes, along with several vegetarian options to cater to different dietary preferences. Additionally, we can provide beverages and a bar service, but this would be at an extra cost.  

Please let me know if you have any specific menu items in mind or if you would like to discuss dietary accommodations further. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit. Would it be possible to lower the price to $60 per person? We are expecting around 75 guests, and I would appreciate it if you could confirm whether VAT is included in that price.  

I also wanted to clarify the menu options. Could you provide a few examples of the meat dishes you offer? Additionally, if we decide to include beverages, what would that add to the overall cost?  

Thank you!  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your response and your interest in our services. While I understand your request, I can offer you a price of $62 per person, which would include VAT. With 75 guests, that brings the total to $4,650.  

As for the menu, we can offer options such as herb-roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of sides like roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes. If you wish to include a bar, we typically charge an additional $15 per person for a standard open bar service.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
