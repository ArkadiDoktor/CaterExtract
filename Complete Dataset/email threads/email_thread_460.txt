Dear Rebecca,  

Thank you for reaching out about catering for your upcoming gala on June 15th. We specialize in events of this nature and would be delighted to provide our services. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, inclusive of VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250.  

We offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of dishes, including grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. All our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orchard Heights Rabbinical Council. We would also be happy to provide accommodations for any dietary restrictions you may have, such as gluten-free or vegan options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further or if you have any specific requests.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there's any flexibility in the per person cost, especially if we finalize the guest count soon. Additionally, could you confirm whether the beverages are included in the package, or if we need to arrange that separately?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rebecca,  

I appreciate your inquiry. While the $45 per person is our standard rate, I can offer a slight discount to $42 per person if you can commit to 200 guests. Regarding beverages, our package does not include a bar service, but we can provide a selection of soft drinks and coffee at no extra charge. If you're interested in a full bar, we can discuss those options as well.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
