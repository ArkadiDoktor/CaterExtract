Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Charity Gala  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to follow up on our conversation regarding catering for the charity gala scheduled for April 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you on this event. 

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of hors d'oeuvres, a main course of grilled chicken or beef, and an array of seasonal vegetables. We also provide a dessert buffet with assorted pastries. The pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. 

Additionally, we ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. However, please note that beverages and bar service are not included in this price.  

I would be happy to discuss further details and any specific requirements you may have.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the details. The menu sounds great, but I wanted to clarify a few points. We might have anywhere from 120 to 180 guests, and I would like to confirm if the pricing remains the same for that range. Additionally, can you include a bar service in the package? If that is possible, could you provide an updated quote?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. For a guest count of 120 to 180, the price will adjust slightly to $70 per person if you choose 150 or more attendees. We can certainly include a bar service for an additional $20 per person, which covers a selection of wine, beer, and soft drinks. 

If you decide to proceed, we would require a confirmation at least two weeks prior to the event date, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to one week before the event.  

Please let me know how you would like to move forward.  

Warm regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for the revised proposal. I appreciate your flexibility with the pricing and the inclusion of the bar service. I would like to confirm the catering for 150 guests, which brings the total to $13,500, including VAT but excluding the bar service, which will add another $3,000. 

This gives us a total of $16,500. Please proceed with the arrangements, and I will send over the deposit as soon as I receive the contract.
