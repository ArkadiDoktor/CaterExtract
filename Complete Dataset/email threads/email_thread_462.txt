Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with our catering options for the wedding reception you are organizing on December 10th. We specialize in a range of menu selections, including kosher meat options under the supervision of the Kashrut Authority.  

Our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes a variety of dishes such as grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Please note that VAT is included in this price.  

Additionally, we can provide a full bar service for an extra fee, or you can opt for our non-alcoholic beverage package, which is included in the base price. We are also happy to accommodate specific dietary restrictions such as gluten-free or vegan options.  

If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please feel free to reach out.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the menu options you provided. However, I have a couple of questions.  

Could you confirm if the $75 per person price includes setup and staffing on the day of the event? We are expecting around 120 guests, and I want to ensure everything runs smoothly. Also, could you provide a few more details on the vegetarian options available?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $75 per person does indeed include setup and staffing for the event. Regarding vegetarian options, we can offer dishes like stuffed bell peppers, roasted vegetable platters, and a quinoa salad with seasonal greens.  

If you could let me know by the end of this week, I can reserve the date for you. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to two weeks prior to the event, which I hope provides some peace of mind.  

Please let me know if you need anything else.  

Best,
