Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. At Gourmet Delights Catering, we specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would love to discuss how we can assist you with this event.  

We offer a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing starts at $50 per person, which includes a three-course meal and staff for setup and service. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200 guests. Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or have specific ideas in mind.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The $50 per person pricing sounds reasonable, but I am curious if that price includes VAT. Also, we are looking for kosher options, as many of our attendees observe dietary restrictions. Could you confirm whether your meals are kosher and under what supervision?  

Additionally, we would like to include a bar service for the event. Is that something you can offer? I’d appreciate any recommendations for a mixed menu that would appeal to both meat and dairy eaters.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Our pricing of $50 per person does include VAT. I can confirm that we offer kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our menu can be tailored to include both meat and dairy options, ensuring there is something for everyone.  

As for the bar service, we can provide a selection of beverages for an additional fee of $20 per person. If you decide to go with our catering, we will also take care of the setup and staffing. The final price would be determined based on the actual guest count, but it can range from $50 to $70 per person depending on the menu selections.  

Please let me know if this works for you.

Please confirm that this includes everything—setup, staffing, and that our guests will have a mixed menu.  

Additionally, could you outline your cancellation policy? Looking forward to finalizing this soon.
