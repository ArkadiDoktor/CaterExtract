Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing you mentioned is within our budget, but I would like to clarify a couple of details before moving forward. Could you confirm if the $45 per person includes all bar services, or would that be an additional cost? Also, while I appreciate the kosher certification, could you specify the supervision details?  

We are expecting around 100 guests, and I’d like to ensure we have a variety of dishes that cater to different dietary needs. Can you provide a few examples of the menu items you would suggest?  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions and I'm happy to provide more information. The $45 per person does not cover bar services, which would be an additional $15 per person if you choose to include that. Our kosher supervision comes from the Orthodox Rabbinical Council, ensuring all our food meets stringent guidelines.  

As for the menu, I recommend our herb-roasted chicken, a vegan stuffed bell pepper, and a seasonal salad that can cater to both meat and dairy preferences. We can also offer gluten-free and nut-free options for those with allergies.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can discuss finalizing the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying everything. I believe we can move forward with your proposal. I would like to confirm the catering for 100 guests at $45 per person, making the total $4,500. Since we will not be including bar services, the final price remains at that amount. I appreciate the kosher supervision details and the menu options you've provided.  

Please go ahead and prepare the necessary paperwork, and let me know your cancellation policy. Looking forward to working together to make this event a success!  

Best,
