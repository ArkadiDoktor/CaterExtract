Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss the catering for your upcoming wedding reception scheduled for March 30th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines, and I believe we can create a delightful experience for you and your guests.  

For your event, we offer a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Our menu can be tailored to fit your needs, including vegetarian options and dietary accommodations. Additionally, our food is kosher, supervised by the Star-K organization.  

Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or if you have any specific requests. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. I appreciate the fixed price structure and the flexibility with the guest count. However, I would like to discuss the total cost a bit further. Considering our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a lower price if we were to finalize the contract for 75 guests?  

Additionally, could you clarify whether the $75 per person includes beverages, or would we need to arrange that separately? I am also interested in knowing more about the main course options.  

Thank you, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to stay within budget, and I can offer a reduced price of $70 per person if you confirm for 75 guests. Regarding beverages, the current price does not include a bar service, but we can certainly arrange a separate beverage package tailored to your preferences.  

As for the main course, we have options such as herb-roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a delicious vegetarian lasagna. I can send you a detailed menu for your review.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can get the formal agreement set up.
