Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. We specialize in providing a diverse menu tailored to meet the specific needs of our clients.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes options such as grilled chicken, vegetarian pasta, and a variety of seasonal salads. Our pricing structure is set at £50 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and we are happy to discuss any dietary restrictions your attendees may have.  

Additionally, we can provide a full bar service at an extra cost if you're interested. Please let us know if you would like to proceed or if you have any specific requirements.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound appealing, and I appreciate the clarity on pricing. However, I would like to confirm whether the food is kosher and under what supervision. Also, could you provide more details regarding the cancellation terms?  

If we decide to proceed, we will likely have around 120 guests, and I am curious if there are any additional items you could include on the menu, especially for those with dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Our menu is indeed kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din, ensuring all dietary laws are followed. Regarding cancellation, we require at least 14 days' notice for a full refund.  

As for additional menu options, we can offer gluten-free and vegan dishes as needed. If you would like to proceed with the 120 guests, the total would be £6,000, including VAT and set-up. Please let me know if that works for you.  

Warm regards,  
David from Gourmet Delights
