Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your wedding on June 15th. We would be delighted to assist in making your special day memorable. Our catering services include a variety of menu options tailored to your preferences.  

We specialize in a mixed menu, offering both meat and dairy dishes, and can accommodate various dietary requirements, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our food is kosher, supervised by the local Kashrut authority.  

For pricing, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes a full buffet setup and staffing. This price is inclusive of VAT, and we can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Beverages are not included in this price, but we can arrange a bar service if you're interested.  

Please let me know if you have any specific menu items in mind or if you would like a sample menu to review. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to explore a few adjustments. We expect around 100 guests, but our budget is a bit tight. Would you consider a slightly lower price per person, perhaps around $65?  

Additionally, can you clarify if the VAT is included in the $75, or if that will be added on top? I appreciate the kosher certification and would like to ensure that the meal options align with our expectations.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of staying within budget, and I can offer you a reduced price of $70 per person for your event. This price still includes VAT, ensuring no surprise costs later.  

Regarding the menu, I can offer a selection of dishes including roasted chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a variety of salads. If you opt for the bar service, that would be an additional cost, but we can work together to find a beverage package that suits your needs.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.  

Best,
