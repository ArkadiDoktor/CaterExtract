Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds delicious, especially the mixed options. I’m particularly interested in including a bar with the catering. Could you provide details about drink options and pricing for that?  

Also, while I appreciate the starting price per person, I would like to explore if there's room for negotiation, especially if we end up inviting closer to 150 guests.  

Thank you for mentioning dietary accommodations; we do have some guests with specific needs. Could you confirm if you can handle vegan and gluten-free options?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear you’re interested in our menu. We can certainly provide a full bar package, which would generally be an additional $25 per person. Regarding the pricing, if we reach the maximum of 150 guests, I can offer a total package price of $10,500, which would include the bar and all food.  

We can accommodate vegan and gluten-free dietary requests with advance notice, ensuring all guests have options. As for the cancellation policy, we typically require at least two weeks' notice.  

Let me know if this works for you or if you have any other questions.
