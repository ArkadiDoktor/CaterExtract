Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm glad to hear you can cater our wedding and that you offer a kosher menu. However, I was hoping to review the pricing a bit further. Since we expect around 120 guests, would you be willing to adjust the price to $70 per person? Also, could you clarify if the bar service would be an additional cost?  

We are very interested in having a selection of your grilled chicken and vegetarian options featured prominently.  

Thanks again for your help,  
Anna

Hi Anna,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your position regarding the pricing. We can accommodate your request to lower the price to $70 per person for 120 guests, which brings the total to $8,400. Please note that bar service would be an additional $1,500 if you decide to include it.  

Our kosher menu will feature items like grilled chicken, beef brisket, and a variety of vegetarian dishes, along with options for any dietary needs you might have. Please let me know if you wish to proceed, and we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best,
