Dear Lisa,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event.  

Our standard pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts tailored to your preferences. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and will ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For drinks, we typically offer a bar service that can be added for an additional cost. Please let us know if you would like us to include this in our proposal.  

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to discuss the menu options further. We are considering a mixed menu that accommodates various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.  

Also, could you clarify whether the $45 per person includes VAT? We are planning for around 100 guests, but we may adjust this number depending on final confirmations.  

Please let me know your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Lisa,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can confirm that the $45 per person does not include VAT, which will be an additional 10%. As for the menu, we can certainly provide a mixed selection, featuring dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads. We can also cater to gluten-free and vegetarian needs without any issue.  

If you are looking at around 100 guests, the final price would be $4,950 including VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks in advance. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
