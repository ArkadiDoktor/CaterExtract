Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your event on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater your corporate gala. Our menu options are versatile and can accommodate a variety of dietary needs. We typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, with specific highlights such as roasted chicken, vegetarian pasta, and an array of seasonal salads.  

For pricing, we generally charge $45 per person, which includes setup and staff for the evening. This price is inclusive of VAT and covers a minimum of 50 guests up to a maximum of 150. If you are interested, we can also provide a selection of kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. However, please note that beverages, including a bar service, are not included in the base price.  

I look forward to discussing this further and tailoring the menu to your specific needs.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the catering details. I appreciate the flexibility in your menu options. However, I am trying to keep the budget a bit tighter for this event. Would you be able to lower the price to $40 per person? Additionally, can you confirm if the kosher meals would be fully separate from the non-kosher options?  

Also, we are anticipating around 80 guests, and I wanted to double-check that your cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we cancel at least two weeks in advance.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for getting back to me. I can accommodate the price of $40 per person, but I must inform you that the kosher meals would indeed be prepared in a separate kitchen to ensure compliance.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we do offer a full refund if the cancellation is made at least two weeks prior to the event date. I believe this arrangement will work well for both of us.  

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you’re ready to finalize the details.

Hi Michael,  

I appreciate your flexibility in adjusting the pricing and confirming the kosher options. I would like to move forward with the catering for 80 guests at $40 per person, bringing the total to $3,200. Please ensure that you provide the kosher meals with the proper supervision.  

Additionally, I would like to confirm that the setup will be ready at least two hours before the event starts, and please include the necessary staff for service throughout the evening. I look forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Thank you!
