Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Conference  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering options for your upcoming conference scheduled for April 15th. We specialize in events like yours and would love to help make it a success.  

We offer a variety of menu options to suit different tastes and dietary needs. Our pricing typically ranges from $30 to $50 per person, depending on the selected menu items. We can accommodate between 100 to 250 guests. Our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision, and I can provide details on the supervision if necessary.  

Please let me know if you would like to receive more information about our menu options, including highlights like beef brisket or roasted vegetable platters. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the options you’ve shared. I am particularly interested in the kosher meals, but I would need to confirm if the pricing includes VAT, as well as whether beverages are part of the package or if they are billed separately.  

Additionally, I would like to know more about any dietary accommodations you can provide, especially for those with gluten allergies. If we were to go ahead with the maximum number of guests, could you confirm the final price?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. To clarify, the pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final amount. Regarding beverages, we typically offer a separate bar service, which can be tailored to your preferences.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide gluten-free options and other alternatives as needed. If you decide to move forward with 250 guests, the final price would be $12,500. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal proposal with all the details.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.
