Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our menu features a delightful selection of dishes, including grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a vibrant vegetarian pasta option, all served with seasonal sides. 

We typically price our services at $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. For events like yours, we recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can also offer beverage packages if you're interested. Our pricing includes VAT, ensuring no additional costs at the end. 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific dietary requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details. I wanted to clarify whether the $75 per person includes a bar service or if that would be an additional cost. Also, we might have around 120 guests, but the final count will depend on RSVPs. 

Could you provide some options for dietary accommodations as well? I want to ensure that all guests have something delicious to enjoy. Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your quick follow-up. The $75 per person does not include bar service; we can provide a variety of beverage options at an additional price. For dietary needs, we can offer gluten-free and vegan options to cater to any specific requirements you may have. 

If you confirm a guest count of 120, the total would come to $9,000. Additionally, our cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks prior, with a full refund if canceled before that date. Please let me know how you would like to proceed!  

Best,

Looking forward to working together to make this gala a success!
