Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for November 10th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes a full buffet service featuring a selection of meat, dairy, and vegetarian dishes. We recommend a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150 to ensure a personalized experience. Please note that VAT is included in this price. We also offer beverage packages that can be added separately if you decide to include a bar service.  

If you would like, I can send over a sample menu highlighting some of our popular dishes. Please let me know if you have any specific requirements or questions.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety in your menu options. However, I noticed that the price per person is a bit higher than what we initially planned. Would you be open to discussing a possible adjustment? We are expecting around 80 guests, but I want to ensure we stay within budget.  

Additionally, can you confirm whether your kosher meals include any vegetarian options? It would be great to have a few choices for those who do not eat meat. Also, could you clarify if the beverage package is separate from the meal price?  

I look forward to your thoughts.  

Best,  
Rachel

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your quick response. I understand the need to stick to a budget. I can lower the price to $40 per person if you confirm at least 80 guests. This price includes a selection of kosher meals with vegetarian options, all under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Regarding the beverage package, it would be an additional $15 per person, and we can offer a range of options to suit your preferences. As for cancellation, we typically require a notice of two weeks prior to the event for a full refund.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best wishes,  
Michael

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate the revised price of $40 per person along with the inclusion of vegetarian kosher options. I would like to confirm our order for 80 guests, along with the beverage package. This brings the total to $4,400, inclusive of VAT.  

Please send over the formal agreement at your earliest convenience, and I will review the cancellation policy as discussed. Looking forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Best regards,
