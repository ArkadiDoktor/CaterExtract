Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming corporate gala on December 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would love to assist in making your event memorable.  

For a gathering of this nature, I recommend our mixed menu option, which includes a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing is set at £45 per person, which includes VAT. This package can provide a selection of our signature dishes, such as herb-crusted salmon and roasted vegetable tart.  

Please let me know if you have any dietary requirements or specific requests, and I would be happy to tailor our offerings to meet your needs.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the pricing details. However, I am wondering if there is any flexibility in the per-person rate if we settle on a fixed number of guests. Also, could you clarify if the food is kosher? We're expecting some attendees who observe dietary restrictions.  

Lastly, are beverages included in the package, or would they be an additional cost?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can certainly offer a fixed price of £6,000 for a party of 130 guests, which would effectively lower the per-person cost. Our menu can be fully kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din, ensuring all your guests can enjoy the meal without concern.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in the standard package, but we can arrange for a beverage service at an additional cost if that is something you’d like to consider.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for the updated offer and the clarification on the kosher supervision. I think the fixed price works for us, and I would like to proceed with the arrangement for 130 guests, including the kosher meals. However, we will manage the beverages separately. I appreciate your assistance in accommodating our needs and look forward to a successful event.  

Best,
