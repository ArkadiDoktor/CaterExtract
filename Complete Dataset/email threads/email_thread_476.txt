Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in creating exquisite menus tailored to our clients' needs.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $65, which includes setup and staffing. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests, with a maximum of 250. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements, as we can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Additionally, our food is kosher, supervised by the Jerusalem Kashrut Authority, ensuring it meets all dietary laws. Beverages, including a selection of wines and soft drinks, can be added for an additional cost.  

I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your proposal. The menu sounds wonderful! However, I wanted to clarify a couple of details. We are looking to keep our budget under $10,000 for about 150 guests. Would you be able to adjust the pricing per person or offer a fixed package deal that fits our budget?  

Also, could you confirm if VAT is included in your pricing? Finally, while I appreciate the kosher options, we would also like to explore whether you can provide pareve items for those who may require them.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your quick reply. I can offer a fixed package for 150 guests at a total price of $9,750, which includes VAT. This package would feature a selection of our best meat and dairy dishes. We can also incorporate pareve options for those dietary needs.  

Regarding the beverage service, we can include a basic bar package for an additional $1,500, which covers a range of wines and soft drinks. Please let me know if this works for you, as I want to ensure we meet your expectations for the event.
