Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for June 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this event. 

We offer a diverse range of menu options including both meat and dairy dishes, and our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK. For events like yours, we typically suggest a buffet style to encourage mingling, and we can accommodate anywhere from 50 to 150 guests. 

Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $70 per person, which includes appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We also provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar can be arranged for an additional fee. Please let me know if you have specific dietary requirements, as we can accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian options. 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
David Goldstein

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the information provided. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit, as our budget is currently set at $60 per person. Additionally, could you clarify if the $70 includes VAT, or will that be added on top?  

I understand that a full bar comes at an extra cost, but I think we might opt for a non-alcoholic beverage selection only. Please confirm if that’s possible within our budget.  

Thanks again for your assistance.

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your response and understand your budget constraints. I can adjust the pricing to $65 per person, which will include VAT. This will also allow for a selection of non-alcoholic beverages as part of the package.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can ensure gluten-free and vegetarian options are available, aligning with your guests' needs. Please confirm the guest count, so we can finalize the menu and other details.  

Looking forward to your reply.
