Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out about your upcoming corporate gala on March 15. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our offerings include a variety of menu options designed to suit different tastes and dietary needs. We can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, with options for vegetarian and gluten-free guests as well.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, typically ranging from $50 to $75, depending on the selected menu items. We also ensure all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. Please note that our prices are inclusive of VAT.  

Additionally, we can arrange for a full bar service if required, though that would be an additional cost. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests for this event, with a maximum of 250. Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or have any other questions.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The mixed menu sounds great, and I’m glad to hear about the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to keep our budget closer to $50 per person. Would it be possible to adjust the menu to fit this pricing while still offering some appealing options?  

Also, could you confirm if the bar service can be included in the price, or would that be an extra charge? Finally, can you provide a few examples of dishes that would be included in the $50 range?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback on the pricing. We can certainly work on a menu that fits within the $50 per person budget. For this price, we can offer dishes such as roasted chicken with seasonal vegetables, a selection of salads, and a pasta primavera.  

Regarding the bar service, that would need to be added separately, but I can provide a package deal that could potentially lower the overall cost if you decide to include it. I can also accommodate up to 250 guests if necessary. Let me know your thoughts, and I can draft a more detailed proposal.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the clarification. I think the proposed menu sounds delicious, and I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our budget. I would like to confirm the catering for 150 guests at $50 per person, bringing the total to $7,500, which includes VAT.  

Could you also ensure that the setup is ready by 5 PM on the event day? As for the bar, we will handle that separately. Please send over the contract with the cancellation policy, and we can finalize everything.  

Looking forward to working together.  

Best regards,
