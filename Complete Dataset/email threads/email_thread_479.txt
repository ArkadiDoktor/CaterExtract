Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the detailed menu options you provided. We are expecting around 150 guests, and I would like to confirm if the $45 per person includes everything, or if there are additional costs for beverages. Also, could you clarify if the food is kosher and under what supervision?  

We are also considering a few dietary accommodations, especially for vegan and gluten-free options. If we decide to proceed, what is your cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,  
Jessica

Dear Jessica,  

I appreciate your questions. The $45 per person does indeed cover the food, but beverages would be an additional cost, starting at $15 per person for a basic package. We offer kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring adherence to all guidelines.  

As for dietary options, we can certainly accommodate both vegan and gluten-free requests with prior notice. Regarding cancellation, we require notice at least two weeks before the event for a full refund.  

Please let me know if you would like to finalize this, and I can prepare the agreement.  

Best,  
Mark
