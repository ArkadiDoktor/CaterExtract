Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Catering Solutions. I understand that you are planning a corporate dinner on November 15th for approximately 50 guests. We specialize in creating tailored menus to suit various dietary requirements.  

Our standard pricing is $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal, setup, and staffing. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. If you are interested, I can also provide a selection of beverages, though these would be an additional charge.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further or if you have any specific preferences for the menu. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information. The pricing seems reasonable, but I’d like to clarify a couple of things. Is the $75 per person inclusive of VAT? Additionally, could you provide some details about the menu options available? We are particularly interested in ensuring the food is kosher and what supervision you have in place.  

Also, we might have a few more guests, potentially up to 70. Would that change the pricing structure at all? I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $75 per person does include VAT, and we pride ourselves on offering a delightful selection of kosher options supervised by the Orthodox Union. For the menu, we can provide a mix of meat and dairy dishes, including options like herb-crusted chicken and stuffed portobello mushrooms.  

If you anticipate an increase in guests, we can accommodate up to 80 without changing the per-person rate. However, please note that if you exceed that number, we may need to discuss a different pricing structure. I also want to confirm that beverages are not included in the initial quote, but I can certainly provide a variety of bar packages if you're interested.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thanks for the clarification. I appreciate the details on the kosher supervision and the menu options. Given the inclusive pricing and our anticipated guest count of around 70, I would like to move forward with your catering services for the event on November 15th. Please confirm that the final price will be $5,250, which includes VAT, and let me know how we handle the deposit and cancellation terms.  

I look forward to working with you.
