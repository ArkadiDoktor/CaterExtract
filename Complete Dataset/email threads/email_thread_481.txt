Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to assist you in making your event a success.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, we offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, all under strict rabbinical supervision to ensure they meet kosher standards. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, inclusive of VAT, which covers a three-course meal, setup, and staffing. We can also accommodate special dietary needs upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there are specific dishes you have in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the quick response. The pricing looks good, but I wanted to clarify a few details. We are expecting around 80 guests, and I'd like to consider options for a bar service as well. Would that be included in the per-person pricing, or is that an additional cost?  

Additionally, we have a couple of guests who will need vegan options. Can you accommodate that?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. For the bar service, we can offer a package that includes a selection of wines and beers for an extra $15 per person, which would cover the drinks throughout the evening. As for the vegan options, we can certainly provide dishes that cater to those dietary needs, ensuring all guests have a satisfying meal.  

With these adjustments for 80 attendees, the total would come to $60 per person, which includes VAT. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu and the bar services. I would like to confirm the catering for 80 guests at the total price of $4,800, which includes the vegan options and bar services. Just to reconfirm, we will require cancellation terms of at least two weeks notice in case of any changes.  

Once you confirm, I will send over a deposit to secure the date.
