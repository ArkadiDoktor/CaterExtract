Email 2 – Event Organizer:
Hi David, 

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the details you provided. I am particularly interested in the mixed menu options you mentioned. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further, as our budget is somewhat limited. Is there any flexibility on the per person rate? Additionally, could you clarify if VAT is included in that price? 

I would also like to confirm whether the beverage selection includes a bar service, or if it is strictly non-alcoholic drinks. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Email 3 – Food Supplier:
Hi Sarah, 

I appreciate your concerns regarding the budget. While our base rate is set at 75 per person, I can offer a special package at 70 per person if you book for the maximum of 150 guests. This rate includes VAT and covers a delightful array of meat and dairy options. 

Regarding beverages, we can certainly include a bar service at an additional cost of 15 per person if you decide to go that route. We can also ensure that all dietary accommodations are met as needed. 

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.

Best,

Hi David, 

Thank you for the revised offer. I’m happy to accept the package at 70 per person for 150 guests, which brings the total to 10,500. I appreciate that this amount includes VAT. Please include the bar service in the final arrangements. 

Could you also confirm the cancellation policy and any additional details regarding setup and staffing? Once I have that information, I will proceed with the booking. 

Thanks for your assistance!
