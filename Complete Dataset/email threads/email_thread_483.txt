Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but could you clarify if the £45 per person includes beverages? We are considering having a bar for the event, so I'd like to understand how that might work. Additionally, can you provide details on the kosher supervision for the food? It's important for us to ensure everything aligns with our guests' dietary requirements.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Rachel

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your questions. The £45 per person covers the meal service only and does not include beverages or a bar setup. We can certainly arrange for a cash bar service at an additional cost if that suits your needs. Regarding kosher supervision, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

If you wish, I can provide a revised quote factoring in the bar service. Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best wishes,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with your original proposal of £45 per person for a minimum of 50 guests. We will handle the bar separately and appreciate the kosher certification. Please go ahead and send the sample menu along with any additional details on setup and staffing.  

I look forward to finalizing this with you.  

Best regards,  
Rachel
