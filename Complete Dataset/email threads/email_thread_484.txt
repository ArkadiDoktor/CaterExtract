Dear Sophia,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event. Our menu features a delightful selection of mixed dishes that can cater to a variety of dietary needs. We specialize in kosher options, supervised by the Star-K, ensuring all dietary laws are observed.  

For your event, we typically charge $75 per person, and this includes a full dinner service, setup, and staffing for the evening. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. Please note that VAT will be added on top of the quoted price.  

Additionally, we can provide a bar service, or you may choose to arrange your own beverages. Our team can work closely with you to finalize the menu, which can include options like herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and an assortment of desserts.  

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a call to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Ethan,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, given our budget constraints, I am wondering if there is any flexibility on the price per person. Is there a possibility to adjust the menu to accommodate a fixed price of $65 per person?  

We are expecting around 80 guests. Also, I want to confirm that the quoted price doesn’t include beverages, correct?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sophia,  

I appreciate your feedback and your interest in our services. While I understand your budget concerns, I can offer a revised menu that brings the cost down to $70 per person. This would still allow us to provide a high-quality dining experience while accommodating your requirements.  

The revised menu would include options such as roasted chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a selection of salads. Please confirm if this works for you. I can also assure you that the pricing will include VAT.  

Regarding beverages, they are not included in the package, but we can assist in sourcing them if needed.  

Let me know how you wish to proceed.

Hi Ethan,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to accept your revised offer of $70 per person for 80 guests. Please confirm that the final price, including VAT, will be $5,600. I understand that beverages are not included, and I will arrange them separately.  

Additionally, I assume we can finalize the menu closer to the event date, with options as discussed. Please send over the contract and cancellation terms at your earliest convenience.
