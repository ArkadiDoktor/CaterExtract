Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We are excited to have the opportunity to work with you.  

We specialize in providing a diverse menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring that we accommodate various dietary preferences. Our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and we can offer a mixed menu featuring dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and gourmet salads. We also provide gluten-free and vegetarian options upon request.  

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing for the event. This pricing covers a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that VAT is included in this price. However, beverages and a bar service would be an additional cost.  

I look forward to your response so we can further discuss your needs.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the menu options. I appreciate the kosher supervision, as it's important for our guests.  

Before we proceed, could you clarify if the $75 per person price includes any appetizers or dessert options? Also, would it be possible to reduce the minimum guest count to 40? We are currently finalizing our guest list.  

Additionally, regarding beverages, what are the options if we choose to add a bar service?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can confirm that the $75 per person includes a selection of appetizers and dessert options, such as mini cheesecake bites and seasonal fruit tarts. Unfortunately, we do need to maintain a minimum of 50 guests due to staffing and preparation requirements, but I understand the challenge with guest lists.  

As for the bar service, we can provide a full bar package starting at $25 per person, which includes a variety of wine, beer, and cocktails. We can also offer a limited beverage package if you're looking for something more budget-friendly.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed, and I'll be happy to assist you further.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the clarification on the menu and bar options. I understand the need for the minimum guest count, and I appreciate your flexibility on the menu details.  

After discussing with my partner, we would like to move forward with the catering for 75 guests at $75 per person, including the appetizers and desserts. Please confirm this will be the final price and let me know the next steps regarding the contract and deposit.  

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to working together.
