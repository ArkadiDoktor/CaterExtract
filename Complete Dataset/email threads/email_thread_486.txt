Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your gala on November 10th. We would love to be part of your special event. We offer a range of menu options, including mixed cuisine that can accommodate various dietary needs. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts.  

We can serve between 50 to 150 guests, and I can confirm that our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Rabbinical Council. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages, as they are available at an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your response so we can discuss your specific requirements.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $45 per person price sounds reasonable, but I was hoping we could explore options that might work within a budget of $40 per person if possible. Additionally, could you clarify if VAT is included in this price?  

We expect around 100 guests, and I would like to ensure that we include a bar service as well. Could you provide more details on your beverage offerings?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget concerns. I can adjust the menu slightly to meet the $40 per person target, and I can confirm that the initial price does not include VAT, which would be added on top.  

For the bar service, we can offer a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks, which can be priced separately based on your preferences. If you decide to proceed, I can ensure that we provide a delightful experience for your guests while adhering to kosher standards.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
