Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special event.  

Our catering services include a variety of options tailored to suit your needs, including both meat and dairy dishes. We can provide a mixed menu for your guests, featuring items such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. This rate includes VAT, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbi, ensuring that all dietary requirements are met.  

Please let me know if you have specific dietary restrictions in mind, and if you need beverages or a bar service, as those can be arranged separately. I look forward to your thoughts!  

Best regards,

Hi Maggie,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining your catering options. The mixed menu sounds wonderful, especially with the inclusion of kosher meals. I would like to confirm the minimum guest count of 50 but am wondering if you could offer a discount if we reach 100 guests.  

Could you also clarify if the $45 per person includes dessert, or if that would be an additional cost? Additionally, while we are considering a bar service, I’d like to know the price range for that as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

As for the bar service, we can provide a full open bar starting at an additional $15 per person, depending on the selections you choose.
