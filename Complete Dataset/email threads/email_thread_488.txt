Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on October 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

Please let me know if you would like to include beverage service, as we can offer a full bar package at an additional cost. Additionally, we can work with you to address any dietary needs your guests may have.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing of $50 per person is a bit higher than what we were hoping for. Would it be possible to discuss a lower rate, perhaps around $40 per person?  

Also, could you clarify if the $50 includes VAT or if it will be added on top? Finally, for the beverage service, we are considering a wine and beer option only. Can you provide a specific cost for that?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and your interest in our services. I understand your concerns regarding pricing. I can offer a rate of $45 per person, which includes VAT. For the wine and beer bar, we can provide that at an additional $15 per person.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian options as well as gluten-free dishes if required. Please let me know if this works for your budget and if you would like to move forward with the proposal.

Hi David,  

Thank you for adjusting the pricing. I am pleased to accept your offer of $45 per person, which includes VAT, and the additional cost of $15 per person for the wine and beer bar. This brings our total for 100 guests to $6,000.  

Please confirm that we have a cancellation policy of 48 hours prior to the event and that setup and staffing are included in this agreement. I look forward to working with you to make this event a success.
