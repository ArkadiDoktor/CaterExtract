Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming conference on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this important event. Our team specializes in offering a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For a gathering of between 50 and 150 guests, we typically offer a mixed menu including options such as roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and a selection of fresh salads. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed cost of 45 per person, which includes setup and service staff. Please note that this price does not include beverages.  

Additionally, we can ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, specifically under the supervision of Rabbi Cohen. VAT will be included in the final pricing.  

I look forward to discussing this further and tailoring the menu to fit your needs.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the clarity regarding the menu options and pricing. However, I was hoping to adjust the menu slightly to include a few vegetarian options, as we may have some attendees who prefer not to eat meat. Could you provide a revised quote that accommodates this?  

Also, could you clarify if you offer any beverage packages, as we would like to consider adding that to our catering arrangement? Lastly, if we need to cancel, what is your policy on that?  

Looking forward to your suggestions.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. We can certainly include vegetarian options such as stuffed bell peppers and a quinoa salad. With these additions, the price would adjust to 50 per person.  

Regarding beverages, we offer a variety of packages starting at an additional 15 per person for soft drinks and juices, and 30 per person for a full bar service. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event date.  

Please let me know if this works for you. I'm here to help ensure the event is a success.  

Warm regards,
