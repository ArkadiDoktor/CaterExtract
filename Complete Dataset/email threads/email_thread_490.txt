Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, but I would like to confirm if the $45 per person includes VAT, as that will affect our budget. Additionally, could you provide a few representative menu items? We are considering around 120 guests and may need to discuss dietary accommodations for some attendees who follow vegan diets.

Also, could you clarify whether a bar service is included in the package? 

Thank you for your assistance.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your questions. The price of $45 does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final bill. For your guest count of 120, we can certainly accommodate vegan options, such as a quinoa salad and roasted vegetable platter. 

Regarding the bar service, we can offer a drinks package at an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. Would that work for you? 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
