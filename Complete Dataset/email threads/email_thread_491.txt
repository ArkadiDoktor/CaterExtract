Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our menu features a delightful mix of meat and dairy options, and we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian requests.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which generally ranges from $45 to $65, depending on your final menu selections. This price includes VAT, and we offer a minimum guest requirement of 50, with a maximum of 150 attendees. Please let us know if you would like to see a detailed menu proposal, including some of our signature dishes.  

We can also provide a full bar service, or you may choose to supply your own beverages. As for kosher options, we are certified under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority, ensuring that all food meets the necessary standards.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing range you provided sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to narrow it down to a fixed price per person. Additionally, can you confirm if the menu can include some traditional dishes, such as brisket and latkes?  

I also need to finalize the guest count soon. We are expecting around 100 guests, but we may have a few more. It would be great if you could accommodate up to 120 without any additional fees.  

Lastly, could you please clarify the cancellation policy in case there are any last-minute changes?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. I can offer a fixed price of $55 per person, which will cover a selection of our traditional dishes, including brisket and latkes. We can certainly accommodate up to 120 guests at that rate, with a minimum charge for 100.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made. Any cancellation after that would incur a fee of 25% of the total agreed amount.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a detailed menu and contract.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification and for accommodating our requests. I would like to proceed with the catering arrangement at the fixed price of $55 per person for 100 guests. Please include the traditional dishes we discussed, and I will confirm the final headcount closer to the event date.  

I appreciate the cancellation policy you provided and feel comfortable moving forward. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything.  

Looking forward to working together.
