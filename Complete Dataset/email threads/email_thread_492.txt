I would love to discuss how we can assist you in making this event memorable.  

We offer a range of menu options, including mixed selections that cater to diverse tastes and dietary restrictions. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes an assortment of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and I want to mention that our prices are inclusive of VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. If you are interested, we can also discuss beverage options, including a full bar or a selection of non-alcoholic drinks. Please let me know a convenient time for us to discuss further details.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details. The pricing you mentioned sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to explore a few options. For our gala, we expect around 100 guests, and I would like to know if you can provide any flexibility on the price per person if we reach a larger number.  

Also, could you clarify if the beverages are included in your proposal or if they are separate? It would be great to have a better idea of the overall cost. I appreciate your offer for kosher meals; having options for dietary restrictions is crucial for us.  

Let me know your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I'm glad to hear that you’re considering us for your gala. For a group of 100 guests, we can offer a price of $42 per person, which still includes VAT. As for beverages, we typically offer these separately, but I can prepare a package that includes a selection of wines and soft drinks if that would help.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as needed. Please let me know if you have any specific requests, and I will ensure they are included in our menu.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details with you.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your revised offer. The adjusted price of $42 per person sounds great, and I would like to proceed with that for 100 guests, making the total $4,200. Please confirm that this includes kosher meals and that they will be under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. If we could also include a beverage package, that would be ideal.  

Could you also send over the cancellation policy and any additional setup details? I want to ensure everything is in place for December 15th.  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to working together to make this event successful.  

Best,
