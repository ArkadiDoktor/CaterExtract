Hi Emily,  
Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to explore some flexibility in pricing, as our budget is a bit tighter than anticipated. Would you be willing to consider a fixed price of $65 per person? Also, could you confirm the types of beverages available if we decide to include the bar?  

Looking forward to your reply.  
Warm regards,

Hi Sarah,  
I understand budget constraints can be challenging. While $65 per person is a bit lower than our standard rate, I can offer you a special rate of $70 per person, which would still allow us to maintain the quality of our service and menu. As for the bar, we can provide a selection of wines and spirits, with a full bar setup available at an additional cost of $15 per person. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal contract.  

Best,

Dear Emily,  
Thank you for your understanding and for adjusting the pricing. I am happy to accept the offer of $70 per person for our wedding on June 15th. Please include the bar service in the contract, as we would like to provide our guests with a full selection. I’ll also ensure to send over the final guest count closer to the date. Please confirm the cancellation policy so we are clear on that front. Looking forward to moving ahead!  

Best wishes,
