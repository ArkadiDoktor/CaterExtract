Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Culinary Delights for your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We specialize in providing exceptional catering services designed to enhance your event experience.

For your gathering, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, as well as several vegetarian dishes to accommodate different dietary preferences. Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of fifty dollars per person, with a minimum of twenty guests and a maximum of one hundred. This price includes VAT, and we can ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, specifically by the Orthodox Union.

Please let us know if you would like to explore beverage options or if the food alone meets your needs. We look forward to the possibility of working together and creating an unforgettable culinary experience for your guests.

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your detailed proposal. I appreciate the information you've provided. I do have a few questions before we proceed. Would it be possible to adjust the menu to include more vegetarian and gluten-free options? Additionally, could you clarify whether the fifty dollars per person includes any beverages, or would that be an extra charge?

I look forward to your response so we can finalize the arrangements.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your prompt reply. We can certainly adjust the menu to include additional vegetarian and gluten-free options to ensure all your guests are accommodated. Regarding beverages, the fifty dollars per person covers the food only. However, we can offer a beverage package for an additional fifteen dollars per person, which includes soft drinks, juices, and coffee.

If you decide to go with the full package including beverages, the total would be sixty-five dollars per person. Please let me know your preference, and we can move forward with the arrangements.

Best,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to proceed with the full package at sixty-five dollars per person, which includes both the food and beverages. Please prepare the menu with the additional vegetarian and gluten-free options as discussed. I also want to confirm that the event will take place on March 15th, and I understand that if we need to cancel, we will need to do so at least one week in advance.

Looking forward to finalizing everything!
