Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our offerings include a range of options from a kosher menu, supervised by the Orthodox Union, to ensure all dietary needs are met.  

For your gala, we typically recommend a mixed menu that can include a variety of meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing starts at $50 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. We can accommodate between 100 to 250 guests and ensure that any dietary restrictions are handled with care.  

Please note that our prices are inclusive of VAT and we can provide a selection of beverages at an additional charge. I look forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate the attention to dietary accommodations. However, I was hoping to negotiate the pricing a bit. Given our budget constraints, could you possibly offer a fixed price of $45 per person? Additionally, what are the specific dishes you would suggest for the menu?  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

I understand the need to work within a budget and am happy to offer $45 per person for your event, provided we can confirm a minimum of 150 guests. The menu can feature highlights such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. Our team will ensure everything is handled smoothly on the day of the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.
