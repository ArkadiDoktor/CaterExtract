Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on December 5th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. We specialize in a variety of menu options, and I can assure you that we will create a bespoke culinary experience for your guests.  

Our pricing structure is flexible and typically ranges from 50 to 75 dollars per person, depending on the menu selection. We offer both kosher and non-kosher options, with our kosher meals supervised by the local Orthodox Rabbi. We can provide a mixed menu that includes a selection of meat and dairy dishes to cater to diverse preferences.  

Additionally, we can set up a bar service that includes a variety of beverages, or we can focus on a non-alcoholic option if that is preferable. As for dietary restrictions, we can accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian options upon request.  

Please let me know your estimated guest count, and I can provide a more detailed proposal based on your needs. I look forward to your response.  

Warm regards,

Hi Martin,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are anticipating between 100 and 150 guests for the gala. I appreciate the flexibility in your pricing, but I would like to clarify if the rates you mentioned include VAT. Additionally, could you provide a sample menu with some representative dishes?  

If possible, I would prefer to keep the bar service separate, as we might only require soft drinks and water. Please let me know if that affects the pricing.  

Looking forward to your updated proposal.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for the additional details. The pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the per-person cost. For a guest count of 125, the total would be approximately 9,375 dollars based on the mid-range pricing.  

Regarding the menu, I can prepare options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and assorted salads. If you prefer a kosher menu, we will ensure everything is prepared under the supervision of the local rabbi.  

I can confirm that we can adjust the bar service to only include soft drinks and water without impacting the overall pricing significantly. Please let me know if you would like to move forward, and we can discuss the cancellation terms, which are typically 14 days prior to the event.
