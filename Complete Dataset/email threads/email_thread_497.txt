Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights for your catering needs. We specialize in providing high-quality food for various events, and I would love to help you with your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th.  

Our pricing typically starts at $45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring a selection of meats and vegetarian options. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests, and our pricing is inclusive of VAT. We also offer a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary requirements are met.  

In terms of beverages, we can provide a full bar package that can be tailored to your preferences. I can send over a sample menu that includes popular items such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the kosher options available. However, I was hoping to keep the budget closer to $40 per person. Is there any flexibility in your pricing? Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service is included in that price or if it would be extra?  

I’m also interested in knowing if you can accommodate any dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free or vegan options.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Samantha

Hi Samantha,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget concerns. We can adjust the menu slightly to bring the price down to $40 per person while still offering delicious options. The bar service would be an additional cost, but I can provide a range of options to fit your budget.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly include gluten-free and vegan options in the menu. I’ll ensure to send a revised menu reflecting the changes along with the bar options.  

Let me know if this sounds acceptable, and I will get that information to you shortly.  

Best regards,
