Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I represent Gourmet Delights, where we specialize in providing catering services for various events. I understand you are organizing a gala dinner on March 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can assist you with your catering needs.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed choices, and all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing typically ranges from $45 to $75 per person, depending on the selected menu items and any dietary accommodations you may require. Additionally, all our prices include VAT.  

Could you please provide me with the expected number of guests? We generally cater for a minimum of 50 and can accommodate up to 150 guests. I look forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for reaching out. We are indeed expecting around 120 guests for the gala dinner, and I appreciate the information you provided on your menu options.  

Could you clarify if the pricing covers a bar service as well? Additionally, I would like to know if you can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options, as a few of our guests have dietary restrictions. We are looking for a mixed menu that includes some traditional favorites.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your response. I can confirm that our pricing does not currently include bar service, but we can certainly arrange for a beverage package if that’s something you would like. As for dietary accommodations, we can easily provide vegetarian and gluten-free options for your guests.  

For the mixed menu, I would recommend some of our signature dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. Based on your guest count of 120, the total would be $60 per person, making the overall price $7,200, which also includes VAT.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I would be happy to discuss further details or adjustments.  

Best,
