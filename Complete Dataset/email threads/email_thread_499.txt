Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Rachel,

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your catering needs. I understand you are organizing a wedding reception on June 15th for approximately 100 guests. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu, including meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT.

We also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. In addition, we can accommodate dietary restrictions on request, such as gluten-free and vegetarian options. We do not include beverages in our standard package, but we can provide a full bar service at an additional cost.

If you would like, I can send over a sample menu and discuss setup and staffing requirements further. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Best regards,

Dear David,

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The $75 per person price point is a bit higher than my initial budget. Would you be able to accommodate a lower price, perhaps in the $60 to $70 range? We are expecting between 80 to 120 guests, depending on final RSVPs.

Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy? It’s important for us to have that information as we finalize our plans.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Rachel,

I appreciate your feedback. I can adjust the price to $70 per person for your event, which would include everything mentioned earlier, like the kosher meals and dietary accommodations. The final price for 100 guests would then be $7,000, with VAT included. 

As for the cancellation policy, we typically require 14 days' notice for any cancellations, after which a fee may apply. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over the revised contract.

Best,
