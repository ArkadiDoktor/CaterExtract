Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to confirm our conversation regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for October 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to suit various dietary needs.  

For this event, we can offer a diverse menu featuring a selection of meat and vegetarian options, ensuring there is something for everyone. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal, setup, and staffing. This price is inclusive of VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and we also offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed information regarding your catering options. I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person price includes beverages, as we are considering a separate bar service. Additionally, could you provide a sample menu with some highlighted dishes?  

We are expecting a final guest count closer to 150, and I want to ensure we can accommodate any dietary restrictions our guests may have.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person pricing does not include beverages, but we can certainly discuss beverage options if you're interested. As for the menu, I can provide a sample that includes dishes such as grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, a vegan pasta option, and a rich chocolate tart for dessert.  

We can easily accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and nut-free options. If you confirm the guest count of 150, we can finalize the total cost at $11,250, which will still include VAT. Please note that our cancellation policy requires at least two weeks’ notice before the event.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.
