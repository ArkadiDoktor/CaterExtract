Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in providing delicious meals tailored to corporate gatherings and can accommodate a range of dietary needs.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring that all guests find something they enjoy. Our pricing is structured at £35 per person, which includes VAT, and we can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. We also have a selection of beverages available, but these would be priced separately.  

All our food is kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din, and we can cater to vegetarian and gluten-free diets as well. Please let me know if you’d like to see a sample menu or discuss further details.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details provided about your catering services. After reviewing the initial proposal, I’m wondering if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we decide to go with a higher guest count. Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service can be included in the overall package or if it’s strictly separate?  

We’re aiming for around 120 guests, so any adjustments to the pricing would be helpful.  

Best,  
Sarah Mitchell

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For 120 guests, we can offer a price reduction to £32 per person, which still includes VAT. Unfortunately, the bar service will need to be separate, but I can recommend a few excellent providers if that would help.  

Please let me know if you would like a detailed menu to review or if there are any specific dishes you had in mind. We aim to ensure that your event is a memorable one.  

Best regards,
