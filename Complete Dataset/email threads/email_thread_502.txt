Dear Sophie,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. Our standard menu features a delightful mix of meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For this event, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests, ensuring that we meet the needs of your attendees. Additionally, we can offer a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, featuring items like grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a variety of seasonal vegetables.  

I would also like to confirm if you require a bar service or if it will be separate. Please let me know your preferences or if you have any dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Looking forward to your response!  

Best regards,  
David from Gourmet Delights Catering

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision, as that is essential for our guests. However, I would like to clarify a couple of points. We are expecting around 150 guests, so your pricing seems reasonable, but could we discuss possibly lowering the price to $40 per person? Additionally, could you let me know if the bar service is included in the $45 price?  

I’m also curious about any specific dietary accommodations you offer, as we may have some guests with allergies.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,  
Sophie

Hi Sophie,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the pricing. While we can’t reduce the base price to $40 per person, I could offer a package deal at $42 if we secure a minimum of 150 guests. This would still include VAT but would not cover the bar service, which can be arranged separately at an additional cost.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request, ensuring all your guests are well taken care of.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed!  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the $42 per person pricing for 150 guests, including the mixed menu with vegetarian options. Please confirm that the final price will be $6,300, and I would like to finalize the arrangements. I understand the bar will be separate, and I will handle that on my end.  

Looking forward to a successful event!  

Best,  
Sophie
