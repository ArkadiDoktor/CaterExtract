Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Events. We are excited about the opportunity to cater your wedding on June 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can provide a menu that suits your needs. Our services include setup, staff, and all necessary equipment.  

For your event, we typically suggest a mixed menu, which can include options like grilled salmon, rosemary chicken, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing is structured at a rate of $85 per person, which includes VAT. This price is applicable for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

Please let me know if you are interested, and I would be happy to provide a detailed menu and discuss further.

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options you've mentioned sound appealing. However, we are working with a tighter budget and would like to see if there is any flexibility in the pricing. We are aiming for around 100 guests. Could you provide a revised quote if we adjust the menu to include fewer meat options? Also, could you clarify if the food is kosher and under what supervision? Lastly, we are considering including a beverage bar, so please let me know how that impacts the overall cost.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns about the budget. We can certainly adjust the menu to offer a selection of meat and pareve dishes, which may help reduce costs. If we modify the menu, I can bring the price down to $75 per person. Our food is kosher, supervised by the OK certification.  

As for the beverage bar, we can include a basic package with soft drinks and wine for an additional $15 per person. If you prefer a full bar, that would be a separate quote. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,

Regarding cancellation, could you please confirm your policy on that? I look forward to your confirmation, and I will send over a signed contract shortly.
