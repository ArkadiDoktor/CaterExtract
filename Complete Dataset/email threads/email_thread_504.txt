Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our standard offering includes a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring that we accommodate various dietary preferences.  

For a guest count ranging from 50 to 150, we typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. Our pricing is inclusive of VAT, and we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority.  

We can also offer a selection of beverages for an additional cost if you’re interested in including a bar service. I would be happy to discuss tailored menu options further.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person covers the full meal service, including appetizers and desserts, or if there are additional charges for those. I’m also curious to know more about the dietary accommodations you can provide, as we have a few guests with specific needs.  

Lastly, could you confirm if the bar service is available as a package deal or if it’s a separate cost? We are anticipating around 100 guests, so I’d like to finalize the details soon.  

Best,  
Jessica

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your questions. Yes, the $75 per person includes a full meal service, which features a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can certainly accommodate dietary needs such as vegetarian and gluten-free options without any extra charge.  

Regarding the bar service, we can provide a package for $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Alternatively, if you’d like to manage the beverages separately, we can adjust the food price accordingly.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,  
Mark

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for clarifying everything. I would like to proceed with the package at $75 per person, along with the bar service for an additional $20 per person. This brings the total to $95 per person, which is acceptable for our budget. Please confirm that this includes VAT and that we can expect the kosher meal supervision as mentioned.  

Also, I’d like to confirm your cancellation policy in case of any changes. Once I have that, we can finalize the agreement.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Jessica
