Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss your catering needs for the charity gala scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for events of this nature and can create a menu tailored to your vision.  

We offer a range of options, including meat, dairy, and mixed menus, with vegetarian selections available. Our pricing structure is typically set at a fixed rate of $75 per person, and this includes setup and staffing. Please note that we do provide kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council.  

I would be happy to provide a sample menu and discuss any dietary accommodations you may require. Additionally, we can include a bar service for an extra fee.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but we are expecting between 100 to 150 guests, so it would be helpful to know if there are any discounts available for larger parties. Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT?  

We would like to ensure that the food is kosher, and I appreciate you mentioning the supervision. Are there specific menu items you could recommend that are particularly popular? Lastly, we’re also considering whether to include a bar service, so any details on that would be useful.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. For a guest count of 100 to 150, I can offer a discount that brings the price down to $70 per person. The quoted price does include VAT, so there won’t be any additional charges on that front.  

As for menu highlights, some popular dishes include herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. We can certainly accommodate various dietary needs as well. Regarding the bar service, we can provide a fully stocked bar for an additional $20 per person, which would cover drinks and staff.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed to finalize the details.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the updated proposal and the clarification on pricing and menu options. I am pleased to confirm the catering for our charity gala on March 15th for 120 guests at the agreed price of $70 per person, including VAT. I would like to proceed with the mixed menu, which includes the herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetable lasagna, along with a standard bar service.  

Could you please send over the final contract for my review? Looking forward to working together.
