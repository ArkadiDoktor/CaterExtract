Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding reception on December 15th. We would be thrilled to assist you in creating a memorable dining experience for your guests. Our catering service specializes in kosher meals, and we are under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary laws are strictly followed.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes. For your event, we can provide a buffet-style service that includes appetizers, main courses, sides, and desserts. Our pricing is structured at $60 per person, which includes setup and staffing. This price also includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests, and we will work with you to create a tailored menu that suits your preferences.  

Could you please let me know if you would like to include a bar service, or if you have any specific dietary needs we should consider?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed information. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision you provide.  

Before we proceed, I have a couple of questions. We are expecting around 100 guests, but we might have a few more depending on final RSVPs. Would you be able to accommodate up to 120 guests? Also, could you provide a few examples of the menu items you typically offer?  

Lastly, we would like to include a bar service. Can you provide a revised quote with that included?  

Thank you!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick response. We can certainly accommodate up to 120 guests without any issues. For the menu, we typically offer items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, a selection of vegetarian dishes, and a variety of seasonal salads.  

Including bar service would be an additional $15 per person. Therefore, with the revised quote, the total would be $75 per person for 120 guests, which brings the final price to $9,000. This price also includes VAT and covers all staffing and setup requirements.  

Please let me know if this works for you, or if there are any other adjustments you would like to discuss.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the updated proposal. The menu items you mentioned sound delightful, and I appreciate your flexibility with the guest count. I am happy to confirm the catering for 120 guests at $9,000, including the bar service.  

I also understand that the cancellation policy requires notice two weeks prior to the event, which is acceptable. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize the details.  

Looking forward to working with you!
