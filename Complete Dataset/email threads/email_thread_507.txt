Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed menu options. I appreciate the flexibility with dietary accommodations. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. With our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a lower per-person rate? We are expecting around 100 guests, and ideally, we could work within a range of $50 to $60 per person.  

Additionally, could you clarify if your kosher meals are supervised and what kind of supervision you have? This is important for our attendees.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I understand the need to stay within budget, and I can offer you a reduced rate of $60 per person for your event with 100 guests. Our kosher meals are supervised by the OK Kosher Certification, ensuring the highest standards.  

As mentioned before, the price includes VAT, but beverages will still need to be arranged separately. We can assist with the bar setup if you decide to go that route. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best regards,
