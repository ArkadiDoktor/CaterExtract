Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I'm reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for May 15. We specialize in providing exquisite dining experiences, and I would love to discuss how we can cater this event for you.  

Our pricing typically starts at $45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring a selection of meats and seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate anywhere from 50 to 200 guests, and our menus can be adjusted to cater to various dietary needs. We pride ourselves on using high-quality ingredients, and all our food can be made kosher under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council.  

If you’re interested, I can send a sample menu and additional details. Please let me know your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed an exciting event for us. I appreciate the initial pricing you provided. However, could you clarify if this price includes VAT? Also, would it be possible to include a selection of beverages, or would that be an additional cost? We expect around 150 guests, and I want to make sure everything is covered in the budget.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. To clarify, the $45 per person does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the total. As for beverages, we can offer a package that includes a wine and beer bar for an additional $15 per person. This would put the total at $60 per person if you choose to include drinks.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly offer vegetarian and gluten-free options as well. If we proceed, I can ensure everything is tailored to your needs. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Warm regards,
