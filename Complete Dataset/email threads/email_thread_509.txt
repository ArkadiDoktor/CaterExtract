Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event. We specialize in providing comprehensive catering services and would love to assist you. For your event, we can offer a diverse menu that includes a variety of meat dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which typically ranges from thirty to fifty dollars, depending on the specific menu items you choose. We can cater for a minimum of fifty guests and can accommodate up to two hundred. We also provide a selection of beverages, but please note that a full bar is not included in our standard packages.  

The event date you mentioned is April 15, and we would be happy to discuss the specific menu options available. Additionally, we can address dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, to ensure all your guests are satisfied.  

Please let me know a convenient time for us to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided about your kosher options and pricing. Since we expect around one hundred guests, could you confirm if the pricing includes VAT or if that will be added on top? Also, I am particularly interested in the types of dishes you can offer, especially any signature items, and whether you can accommodate other dietary restrictions beyond vegetarian and gluten-free.  

I would also like to clarify the cancellation policy in case our numbers change. Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I’m glad to hear from you. The pricing I mentioned does include VAT, so there won't be any additional charges in that regard. For the one hundred guests, the final price would be four thousand dollars. As for the menu, I recommend our herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetable platter, which are crowd favorites. We can certainly accommodate other dietary restrictions such as nut allergies and lactose intolerance.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event to avoid any cancellation fees. I hope this information helps, and I’m happy to discuss further if you have any other questions.  

Best,
