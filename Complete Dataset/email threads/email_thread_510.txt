Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Klein, and I’m with Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on December 15th, and I would love to provide our catering services for the event.  

We specialize in a variety of cuisines, including kosher options, and can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We offer a mixed menu that features dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of desserts.  

Additionally, we can provide beverages upon request, although they are not included in the base price. Our team will handle all setup and staffing needs for the event, ensuring a smooth experience.  

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss this further or if you have specific dietary requirements to consider.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the proposal. The gala is indeed an important occasion for us. I appreciate the details you've included, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in the pricing. Given our budget constraints, would you consider reducing the per-person rate?  

Also, could you clarify whether the kosher meals are supervised by a recognized authority? We need to ensure that all dietary restrictions are accommodated, especially for our guests who require kosher options.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback regarding the pricing. I can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person if you can confirm a minimum of 75 guests. As for the kosher meals, they are supervised by the local Orthodox Rabbinical Council, ensuring all dietary needs are met.  

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and I can send over a more detailed menu, including options for guests with additional dietary restrictions. I want to make sure we provide a memorable experience for everyone attending the gala.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the pricing and the clarification regarding the kosher supervision. I’m happy to confirm that we will go ahead with your services for 100 guests at the rate of $40 per person, making the total $4,000.  

Please ensure that our menu includes vegetarian options as well as gluten-free dishes, as some of our guests have those dietary needs. I understand the cancellation policy is 14 days prior to the event, which works for us.  

Let’s proceed, and I look forward to finalizing the details soon.
