Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Culinary Delights regarding your upcoming event. We are excited to potentially partner with you to cater your wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs, and we pride ourselves on using fresh, high-quality ingredients.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes options for both meat and dairy. Our pricing starts at $50 per person, and we can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests. This price covers a three-course meal, including appetizers, a main course, and dessert. Please let us know if you require any beverages, as those are not included in the base price.  

All of our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets the highest standards. We can also provide dietary accommodations for vegetarian and gluten-free guests upon request.  

Looking forward to your feedback so we can discuss this further.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds appealing, but I was hoping to get a bit more flexibility on the pricing, especially since we anticipate more guests than the minimum you mentioned. Is there any room for negotiation if we decide to go with a larger group, say up to 200 guests? Also, can you confirm if the $50 price includes VAT?  

I appreciate your insight into the kosher certification, and I would like to clarify that we will need to offer both vegetarian and gluten-free options as well. Please let me know what adjustments can be made to accommodate these requests.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and for clarifying your needs. I can certainly offer you a revised package for 200 guests at a rate of $48 per person, which would total $9,600. This price does include VAT, and we can certainly ensure that vegetarian and gluten-free options are available.  

Regarding beverages, if you would like to include a bar, we can offer a package starting at an additional $15 per person. If you prefer, we can also supply a selection of non-alcoholic drinks at no extra charge. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can discuss the next steps.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your revised proposal. After discussing it with my team, we would like to proceed with the catering for 200 guests at $48 per person, which brings the total to $9,600. We will include the bar option, so please adjust the final price accordingly. We appreciate the attention to our dietary needs and are confident that your team will provide excellent service on the day of the event.  

As for cancellation terms, could you please confirm those before we finalize the agreement? Once we have that information, I am ready to proceed.
