Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I was excited to hear about your upcoming wedding on April 15th and would love to discuss catering options for your special day. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can provide a delightful menu tailored to your preferences.  

For a wedding, we typically offer a fixed price of $85 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options like grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing includes VAT.  

Additionally, our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can offer a mixed menu with vegetarian options available. If you're also interested in beverages, we can include a bar service at an additional cost.  

Please let me know a convenient time for us to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing, but I was hoping to explore a slightly lower price point, as our budget is a bit tight. Would you be open to discussing a price of around $75 per person? Additionally, can we clarify if the bar services are mandatory or if we can exclude them?  

I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand the budget constraints and can offer the price of $75 per person if we adjust the menu slightly to a more streamlined option, which would include grilled chicken, a vegetarian pasta dish, and a garden salad. The bar service can be excluded if you prefer, but I recommend considering a beverage package to enhance the guest experience.  

Please confirm if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your willingness to adjust the menu and pricing. I am happy to accept the offer of $75 per person for the streamlined menu. We will go without the bar service for now. Please send over the formal agreement, and let’s finalize the details.  

Looking forward to working together!  

Best,
