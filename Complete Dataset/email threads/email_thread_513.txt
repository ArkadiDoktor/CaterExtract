Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Events for your upcoming corporate gala on April 15th. We specialize in providing exquisite catering services tailored to your needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, ensuring a delightful experience for all guests. Our pricing structure is flexible, starting at $50 per person, depending on the final selection of dishes. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a list of menu highlights, including herb-roasted chicken, gourmet pasta, and fresh seasonal salads. Additionally, we can include a selection of beverages, but please let us know if you would like to add a full bar service.  

Please note that our prices include VAT. Should you need to cancel, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event. I look forward to discussing this further and crafting a memorable experience for your guests.  

Best regards,

Hi Martin,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, but I wanted to clarify a few points before we proceed. Would you be able to adjust the price to $45 per person if we were to finalize the guest count closer to the date? Also, while I appreciate the kosher options, could you confirm if you provide any vegetarian or gluten-free dishes for guests with dietary restrictions?  

Regarding the bar service, could you specify what beverages are included in the base price? I look forward to your responses so we can move ahead swiftly.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your quick response. I can agree to the $45 per person rate, provided we confirm a minimum of 75 guests. As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly include vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our base beverage selection includes soft drinks, juices, and coffee. If you'd like a full bar with cocktails and spirits, we can discuss that as an additional service.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I'll prepare a revised proposal for confirmation.  

Best regards,
