Hello David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided. The corporate gala is indeed scheduled for November 15th. However, we are considering a guest list closer to 120 people. Can you confirm if the price remains the same for that number? Additionally, I would like to know if your meals are kosher and under what supervision, as this is an important requirement for our attendees.  

Lastly, could you clarify whether beverages are included in the initial pricing, or would that be an additional cost?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your email. I can confirm that the pricing of $45 per person remains consistent for up to 150 guests. Our meals are indeed kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union, which should meet your needs. Regarding beverages, we typically offer a separate bar package, which can be tailored to your preferences, but it is not included in the initial price.  

If you would like, I can provide a detailed menu that highlights a few popular items, such as our herb-roasted chicken and a selection of seasonal vegetables, alongside dessert options like chocolate mousse and fruit tarts. We also have options for dietary accommodations.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your clarifications. I appreciate your flexibility with the pricing and the kosher supervision detail. After reviewing everything, I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests at the agreed price of $5,400, including VAT. Please prepare the detailed menu for our review. Additionally, I confirm that we will handle the bar separately, so no need to include beverages in your final proposal.  

As per our discussion, I understand that the cancellation policy allows for changes up to a week prior to the event. Please confirm this and any additional details regarding setup and staffing.  

Looking forward to finalizing this with you.  

Best wishes,
