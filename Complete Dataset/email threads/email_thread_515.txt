Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on June 15th. We would be delighted to cater for your event, which I understand will host between 50 to 100 guests. Our catering service specializes in providing a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For the pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes all food items and service staff. This price is inclusive of VAT, ensuring that there are no hidden costs. Our menu features a selection of dishes, such as grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, penne arrabbiata, and a delightful assortment of desserts. We can also work with you to include kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety you offer, especially the vegetarian options. However, considering our budget constraints, would it be possible to lower the price to $40 per person? Additionally, can you confirm if the kosher meals will meet our requirements for the event?  

We are also considering including a beverage service. Could you provide clarity on whether drinks would be part of the package or if that would incur additional costs?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can adjust the price to $40 per person for the minimum of 50 guests, which will still allow us to provide quality service and food. The kosher meals will indeed be under the supervision of the local rabbi, ensuring they meet all requirements.  

Regarding beverages, we can include a basic bar service for an additional $15 per person, which includes soft drinks and a selection of wines. If you would like a more extensive bar with cocktails, we can discuss that as well.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for accommodating the price adjustment and clarifying the kosher supervision. I appreciate the options for the beverage service as well. I would like to proceed with your proposal at $40 per person for 75 guests, which totals $3,000. Please ensure that the setup is ready by 5 PM on June 15th, as our event starts shortly after.  

I understand the cancellation policy is flexible, but could you confirm the specifics? Once I have that information, I’ll send over the deposit to secure the booking.  

Thanks for your assistance.
