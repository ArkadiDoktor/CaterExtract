Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Our catering services are tailored to provide a memorable experience, and we offer a range of menu options that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For a gala like yours, we generally recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes all food preparation and service staff. Please note that our prices do not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final invoice.  

We can cater to a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250. If you have specific dietary requests, such as kosher meals, we can certainly provide those under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can discuss beverage options, though they are not included in the base price.  

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a time to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the quick response and the details provided. I appreciate that you can accommodate our dietary needs and the option for kosher meals. However, I was hoping to clarify the beverage situation. Can you tell me more about what drink options you typically offer, and if they can be included in the package?  

Additionally, is there any flexibility on the per-person pricing, especially if we decide on a higher guest count? We anticipate around 150 guests but would like to keep options open for more.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear back from you. Regarding the beverages, we can offer a variety of packages, including wine and soft drinks, but these would be additional to the $75 per person rate. If you would like an all-inclusive package that covers drinks, we can create a custom quote based on your preferences.  

As for the pricing, we can reduce the per-person cost to $70 if your guest count exceeds 200. However, if it remains around 150, we would need to stick with the original price. All food will be prepared in accordance with kosher guidelines, and we can ensure that the setup is seamless.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best wishes,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the updated details. I appreciate your flexibility on the pricing and the beverage options. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests at the original rate of $75 per person, which brings the total to $11,250. I assume this includes all food service staff and setup as well.  

Please confirm that VAT will be added on top of that and that the kosher meals will be under the Orthodox Union supervision as discussed. We are also clear on the cancellation terms, which I believe is a two-week notice.  

Looking forward to finalizing our agreement.
