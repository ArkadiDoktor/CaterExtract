Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your catering needs for the charity gala scheduled for November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to serve you and your guests. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher catering and can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200.  

Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, along with vegetarian dishes to cater to various dietary preferences. Additionally, all our food is under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest kosher standards.  

We also provide beverages as part of our service, but please note that a full bar is not included. I would be happy to discuss menu options such as grilled chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of seasonal vegetables.   

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, and I appreciate the kosher certification details. However, we are considering a slightly larger guest count, possibly up to 250. Would you be able to accommodate that, and would the price change? Additionally, could you provide a few more specific menu items?  

Also, could you clarify the cancellation policy if we decide to move forward?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in expanding the guest count. We can accommodate up to 250 guests, but I would need to adjust the pricing to $43 per person for that number. The final cost would be $10,750, which still includes VAT.  

As for the menu, I suggest items like herb-marinated lamb chops, roasted vegetable medley, and a selection of gourmet salads. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event to avoid any fees.  

Please let me know if this works for you, or if you have any other questions.  

Best,
