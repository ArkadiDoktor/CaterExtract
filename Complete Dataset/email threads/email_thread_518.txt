Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Conference  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming conference on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event.  

We specialize in a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our standard pricing is set at $45 per person, and this includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests.  

For the menu, we can offer highlights such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of pastries. We also provide options for dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free meals. Please let me know if you would like to discuss the beverage options, as they are not included in the base price.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds enticing, and I'm pleased to hear that you can accommodate our dietary needs. However, I wanted to clarify the pricing structure. Would you be open to negotiating the price if we confirm a higher number of guests, say around 180? Also, could you provide more information about the cancellation policy, just in case our plans change?

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I'm happy to confirm that if you move forward with 180 guests, we can reduce the price to $42 per person, which would total $7,560. Regarding the cancellation policy, we typically require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund. After that, we can offer a 50% refund up to three days before the event.  

Let me know if this works for you, or if you have any other questions!
