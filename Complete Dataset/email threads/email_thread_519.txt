Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Events as I understand you are organizing a gala dinner on November 15th and may be interested in our catering services. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher meals, and I would love to discuss how we can make your event a success.  

Our pricing structure typically ranges from $45 to $75 per person, depending on your menu selections and guest count. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and ensure all dishes are prepared under strict rabbinical supervision. Additionally, we offer a variety of menu options, including meat and dairy dishes, as well as vegetarian choices.  

Please let me know if you would like to set up a time to discuss this further.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information about your services. For our gala dinner, we are expecting around 100 guests and are particularly interested in a mixed menu that also accommodates some dietary restrictions, like gluten-free and vegan options.  

Could you provide more details on the specific dishes available within the $45 to $75 range? Also, does this pricing include VAT, and are beverages part of the package?  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For your event, I can recommend a selection that would include starters like roasted beet salad and mains such as herb-marinated chicken or a hearty vegetable lasagna. This menu can accommodate gluten-free and vegan requests as well.  

The price of $75 per person does include VAT, but beverages are not included in that price. We can arrange a bar service separately if you wish. In terms of cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of the deposit.  

Let me know if you would like to proceed with this menu or if you have any other questions.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed response and the menu suggestions. I would like to proceed with the proposed menu and confirm the pricing at $75 per person for 100 guests, which would total $7,500. I will ensure to provide the necessary dietary information within the next week.  

Please send over the formal agreement when you can, and we will take care of the deposit promptly.  

Best regards,
