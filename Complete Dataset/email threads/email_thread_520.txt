Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. Since we expect around 80 attendees, I would like to confirm if the $45 price includes beverages or if that is an additional cost. Also, could you clarify what specific dishes you would recommend for a corporate setting?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your inquiry. The $45 price per person does not include beverages, but we can offer a full bar service starting at an additional $15 per person. For the menu, I suggest a selection of our grilled chicken with chimichurri sauce, a vegetarian quinoa salad, and an assortment of desserts including mini cheesecakes and fruit tarts.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this option or if you have other preferences.  

Best,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for the information. I appreciate the menu suggestions as well. I would like to proceed with the $45 per person for the food and add the bar service for an additional $15 per person. This brings the total to $60 per person, which I’m happy to confirm for 80 guests.  

Please send over the contract and any details regarding the cancellation policy at your earliest convenience.  

Best regards,
