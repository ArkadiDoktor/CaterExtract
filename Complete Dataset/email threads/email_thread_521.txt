Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out about catering for your upcoming wedding on December 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to special occasions like yours. 

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring appetizers, entrees, and desserts, with options to accommodate various dietary needs. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, and we can cater for a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 150 guests. We ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a selection of beverages if required, although bar service is not included in the base price.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. I appreciate the clarity on the pricing and the kosher supervision. Since we expect around 120 guests, I would like to confirm whether the $75 per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top. Additionally, could you provide some examples of the menu items you would suggest?  

We are also considering adding a bar service, so if you could provide pricing for that, it would be helpful.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The $75 per person does not include VAT; it will be added to the final invoice. As for the menu, we can offer options such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads and desserts. 

For the bar service, we can provide a full bar setup, including wine, beer, and cocktails, for an additional $25 per person. Just to confirm, the $75 per person price would bring the total to $9,000 for 120 guests, plus VAT and any bar service you choose. 

Please let me know your thoughts, and I can draft a formal agreement.

Please send over the formal agreement, and I will review it to finalize everything. I also appreciate you accommodating our dietary needs.
