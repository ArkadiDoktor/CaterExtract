Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for March 15. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event.  

We offer a variety of menu options including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes, with the ability to accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free requests. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT, and we require a minimum of 50 guests.  

Additionally, we can provide staff for setup and service, ensuring everything runs smoothly throughout your event. If you are interested, I can send over some sample menu items for your consideration.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. I’d like to confirm whether your offerings are kosher and under what supervision, as this is a requirement for our group.  

Also, I’m curious if you have any beverage packages available, or if that would be an additional cost. While I understand the price per person, I would like to know if there’s any flexibility if we have closer to 75 guests.  

Thank you again, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that all our offerings are kosher, supervised by the local Orthodox Rabbinical Council. For beverages, we typically offer a bar package at an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

Regarding the guest count, I can accommodate up to 100 guests at the same price per person, so if we settle on around 75, that would still be $45 per person.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a detailed menu for your review.  

Best,

Thank you for clarifying those details. I’m pleased to confirm our agreement to cater for 75 guests at $45 per person, bringing the total to $3,375. I would like to proceed with your catering for the corporate retreat on March 15, including the beverage package.  

Please send over the menu options as soon as you can, and let me know if you need any additional information. I also appreciate your cancellation policy details in case anything changes on our end.  

Looking forward to working together!
