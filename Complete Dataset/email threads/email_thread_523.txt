Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Green, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand that you are planning a wedding reception on April 15th for approximately 150 guests. We would be thrilled to assist you in making this event a memorable one.

Our catering services include a diverse menu featuring a selection of meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK. We can offer a range of dishes, including herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and an assortment of desserts. 

For pricing, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and service staff. Please note that this price does not include VAT, which will be added on top. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let us know if there are any specific needs.

If you would like to discuss further or have any specific requests, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

David Green

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed menu options. While $75 per person is within our budget, we are hoping to finalize the total cost to better gauge our expenses. If we are looking at around 120 guests instead of 150, would you be able to offer a fixed price for the entire event rather than per person? 

Additionally, could you clarify whether a bar service would be included in this pricing or if it would be a separate charge? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your inquiry. If you decide on 120 guests, we can offer a fixed price of $8,500 for the event. This price includes all food, setup, and service staff, but as previously mentioned, VAT will be added separately. 

Regarding the bar service, we do not include beverages in our standard package, but we can arrange a separate bar service based on your preferences. Additionally, we can accommodate any dietary restrictions you may have.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed. 

Best,

Hi David,

Thank you for clarifying the details. I would like to proceed with your offer of $8,500 for 120 guests, including the menu highlights you provided. However, I want to confirm that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to 30 days before the event, as discussed earlier. 

Once we finalize the contract, I will provide you with the dietary restrictions we need to accommodate. Please send over the agreement at your earliest convenience so we can move forward.
