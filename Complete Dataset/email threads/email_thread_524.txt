I understand you are organizing a wedding reception on March 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can assist you with your catering needs.  

We offer a range of menu options, including both meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $75 per person and includes setup and staffing for the event. We can easily accommodate between 100 and 150 guests.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The wedding reception is indeed on March 15th, and I appreciate your details regarding the menu options. I would like to clarify if the $75 per person rate includes VAT, as well as whether beverages will be part of the package.  

Additionally, we may have guests with dietary restrictions, so I would be interested to know what accommodations you can provide. If all goes well, we are looking at around 120 guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. To clarify, the $75 per person pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total. Unfortunately, our standard package does not include a bar, but we can arrange a separate beverage service if you’d like.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free options for your guests. For the 120 guests you mentioned, the total would come to $9,000, including setup and staffing. Should you need to cancel, please note that we require a two-week notice for a full refund.  

Let me know if this works for you or if you have any further questions.  

Best wishes,
