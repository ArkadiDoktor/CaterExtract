Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the flexibility with dietary options. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Given our budget constraints, would it be possible to reduce the cost to $65 per person? Additionally, could you clarify if the bar services can be included in that price, or would it be strictly separate?  

Thanks for your help on this.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to keep costs manageable. I can adjust the price to $70 per person if that works for you, which still maintains the high quality of our offerings. Unfortunately, bar services would need to remain separate, typically averaging around $15 per person for a standard selection of drinks.  

Let me know if this arrangement is acceptable, and I can send over a detailed menu along with the terms regarding cancellation.
