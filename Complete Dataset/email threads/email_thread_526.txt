Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out about catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We specialize in a variety of menu options and can provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing typically starts at $45 per person, which includes a choice of two main dishes, sides, and desserts. We recommend a minimum of 50 guests, and we can accommodate up to 150.  

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards. We can also offer a full beverage service, including soft drinks and coffee, for an additional fee. Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific dietary needs or menu highlights, and I can provide more detailed options.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I was wondering if it’s possible to adjust the price per person to $40 if we confirm for 100 guests. Additionally, could you clarify whether the $45 includes VAT or if that will be added on top? We want to ensure we stay within our budget.  

I appreciate the kosher supervision details, and we will likely have some guests with specific dietary restrictions. Can you accommodate vegetarian options?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in adjusting the price. For 100 guests, I can offer the rate of $40 per person, which does include VAT. We can provide a vegetarian option to accommodate any dietary restrictions as well.  

Regarding the beverage service, if you choose to include it, it would be an additional $10 per person. We generally recommend a selection of soft drinks and coffee, but we can discuss other options if you have specific preferences.  

Please let me know if this works for you.
