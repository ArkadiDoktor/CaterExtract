Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The fixed price per person sounds reasonable, but we are trying to keep the budget tight. Would you be open to negotiating the price if we confirm a higher guest count? We're expecting between 80 and 120 attendees.  

Also, could you provide a sample menu? We want to ensure it aligns with our company's values, especially regarding dietary accommodations. I appreciate that the food is kosher; could you please clarify if you offer any vegetarian or gluten-free options?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. If you confirm a guest count of 100 or more, I can offer a reduced rate of $42 per person, which I believe will help meet your budgetary needs.  

As for the menu, we can provide a variety of options, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes. Some highlights include roasted vegetable lasagna, grilled chicken with lemon herb sauce, and a selection of seasonal salads. I will send you the full menu shortly.  

Please let me know if this pricing works for you, and if you have any further questions regarding setup or staffing.
