Dear Julia,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would be delighted to assist you.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that accommodates a variety of dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests, ensuring we have the capacity to serve your needs.  

I would be happy to discuss the menu options, which can include dishes like herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. Please let me know if you would like to include a beverage service as well, and I can provide a detailed proposal.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds promising, but I would like to clarify a couple of points. Is the menu kosher, and if so, which supervision do you have? Also, could you let me know if the bar service is included in the quoted price?  

Additionally, my budget is a bit tight, so if there’s any room for negotiation on the per-person price, I would greatly appreciate it.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Julia,  

I appreciate your questions. Yes, the menu can be kosher under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. However, the bar service is not included in the initial quote and would be an additional cost.  

Regarding pricing, I can offer a revised rate of $70 per person if we secure the contract by the end of this week. I hope this helps with your budget.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over the updated proposal with the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification and the adjusted pricing. I appreciate your flexibility. The $70 per person is acceptable, and I would like to proceed with the agreement for 150 guests. Please include the kosher certification details and confirm that the cancellation policy will allow for at least a week's notice.  

I look forward to reviewing the final proposal.  

Best regards,
