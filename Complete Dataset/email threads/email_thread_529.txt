Dear James,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. At Gourmet Delights, we pride ourselves on providing exceptional cuisine and outstanding service.  

For your event, I can offer a diverse menu that includes both meat and dairy options, accommodating various dietary restrictions. We can serve between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. Please note that our prices are exclusive of VAT.  

We also offer a selection of beverages; however, a full bar service would be an additional charge. If you have specific dishes in mind, I would be happy to tailor the menu to suit your preferences.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
Sophie Martin

Hi Sophie,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the flexibility in your menu. However, given our budget constraints, I was hoping to discuss the pricing further. Would you be able to offer a fixed price for 100 guests that includes VAT? Additionally, can you confirm that the food is kosher and under which supervision?  

Lastly, we would like to include some vegetarian options as well, as a few of our guests have dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi James,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. For a fixed price of $7,500 for 100 guests, I can include VAT in that amount. The menu will feature a mix of meat and dairy dishes, as well as vegetarian options to cater to all your guests. The food will be certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

As for beverages, if you opt for our premium package, we can include a selection of wines and soft drinks at no extra charge. Please let me know if this works for you, or if you have any adjustments in mind.  

Best wishes,  
Sophie Martin
