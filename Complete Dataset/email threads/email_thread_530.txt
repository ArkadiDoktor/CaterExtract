Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out about catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our catering typically includes a diverse menu that can be tailored to your needs, including options for meat and dairy dishes. 

We generally work on a per-person pricing model, which ranges from $50 to $75, depending on the menu selections and the number of guests. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and can serve up to 200. Our prices include VAT, and we are fully kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. 

Please let me know if you would like specific menu suggestions or have any dietary requirements to consider. I look forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing range you provided is reasonable, but I should clarify that we expect around 150 guests. Could you provide a more specific quote? We are also interested in knowing if the beverages are included in your package or if they would be an additional cost. 

Additionally, we would like to ensure that there are options for gluten-free and vegetarian guests. Can you also confirm the cancellation terms for our booking?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Given your anticipated number of 150 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $10,500, which includes a mixed menu of meat and dairy options, with specific dishes such as herb-roasted chicken and a seasonal vegetable platter. This price also includes beverages, but please note that specialty cocktails would incur an additional charge. 

We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian requests, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event. Let me know if this works for you, and I can provide a detailed menu for your review.  

Best,
