Our pricing is typically set at $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu. We can also discuss options for beverages and any dietary restrictions your guests may have.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your quick response and the details provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to explore a couple of options. We are expecting around 120 guests, and I’m particularly interested in a mixed menu, including some vegetarian options. Can you confirm if the bar service is included in your initial quote?  

Also, I would appreciate it if you could provide a sample menu that highlights some of your main dishes. Once I have that, we can proceed with finalizing the arrangements.  

Best,  
Jessica

Hello Jessica,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. For a mixed menu, we can certainly include vegetarian options along with our meat selections. However, please note that our initial quote does not include bar service; that would be an additional $15 per person.  

I will send over a sample menu shortly, which will showcase our signature dishes, including our beef brisket, roasted vegetable platter, and a variety of salads. If you confirm the 120 guests and decide to go with the bar service, the total would come to $7,800, inclusive of VAT.  

Let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like to proceed.  

Best,  
Mark

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for clarifying the details regarding the bar service and for sending over the sample menu. I'm pleased with the offerings, and I would like to confirm the catering for 120 guests with the mixed menu and bar service included. The total of $7,800 works for us.  

Additionally, I would like to go over the setup and staffing details to ensure everything runs smoothly on the day of the event. Please let me know when you would be available to discuss this.  

Looking forward to working with you!  

Best regards,
