We specialize in a variety of menus, including options that are kosher and suitable for diverse dietary requirements. Our meals can be customized to meet your guests' needs, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 attendees. Pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, which includes VAT.  

Please let me know your preferred menu style, and I can send over some suggestions along with a sample menu for your review. Additionally, we can provide beverage packages if needed.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. Our gala will indeed host around 100 guests, and I appreciate your flexibility. I am particularly interested in a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring we cater to all preferences.  

Could you provide more details about the menu items you typically offer? Additionally, I would like to clarify whether the pricing you mentioned includes beverages or if that is separate. If we proceed, could we finalize everything by next week?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I'm glad to hear about the guest count. Our mixed menu typically features items like roast beef, grilled salmon, and a selection of vegetarian dishes. All our kosher meals are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet the highest standards.  

Regarding beverages, they are not included in the initial pricing but can be added as a package for an additional $15 per person. If you’re ready to proceed, I can secure your date with a 20% deposit, and we can accommodate changes up to a week before the event.  

Let me know how you would like to move forward.  

Best,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for the information. I would like to go ahead with your service. Please prepare a final quote based on 100 guests, including the beverage package, which I believe brings the total to $7,500. I will arrange for the deposit of $1,500 shortly to secure the date.  

I appreciate your attention to detail and look forward to working together to make this event successful.  

Best regards,
