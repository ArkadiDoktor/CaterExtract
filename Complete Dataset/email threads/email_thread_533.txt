Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming charity gala scheduled for June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services and would love to help make your event memorable.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options to cater to diverse tastes. Our pricing structure is typically set at £45 per person, inclusive of VAT. This includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, along with setup and staffing.  

We can comfortably accommodate between 100 and 200 guests. If you have any dietary restrictions or specific requests, please let me know.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
James

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the details provided. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but I wanted to see if there’s any flexibility with the pricing, especially since we are working with a tighter budget for this charity event. Would you be able to adjust the price to £40 per person?  

Additionally, could you confirm if the food will be kosher and what kind of supervision you have in place? It’s important for our guests.  

I appreciate your help with this.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand the budget constraints, and I can offer a reduced price of £42 per person if that works for you. Our menu will be completely kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din, ensuring all dietary needs are met.  

As for the drinks, we can provide a bar service at an additional cost, but beverages can also be excluded if you prefer to handle that separately. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I can finalize the details for our agreement.  

Best wishes,  
James

Hi James,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I accept the offer of £42 per person for the kosher menu, with the understanding that beverages will be arranged separately. I will confirm the guest count closer to the date, but we will aim for around 150 attendees.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience, including the cancellation terms. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to a successful event!  

Best regards,  
Sarah
