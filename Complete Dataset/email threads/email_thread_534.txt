Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming conference on May 15th. We would be delighted to cater the event and provide a menu tailored to your needs. We specialize in a diverse range of cuisines, including kosher options, and can accommodate various dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian dishes.  

In terms of pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes all necessary staffing and equipment for setup. Our menu can include a variety of meat and dairy options, and we can also provide a selection of beverages, though the bar service would be an additional cost.  

Please let me know the expected number of guests, as we can accommodate between 50 and 150 attendees. I look forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are looking at inviting around 100 guests, and I appreciate the pricing structure you provided. Since the event is quite significant for us, could you confirm if the $45 per person includes VAT? Also, I’d like to know more about your kosher supervision and any specific dishes you recommend for the menu.  

We are particularly interested in ensuring the meal is both delicious and suits our guests' diverse preferences. If you can provide a couple of menu highlights, that would be great.  

Thank you,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person does include VAT, and we are under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all food served is strictly kosher. For menu highlights, I recommend our herb-roasted chicken, seasonal vegetable medley, and a delicious quinoa salad that has been a favorite at previous events.  

Regarding beverages, we can offer a standard non-alcoholic package for an additional $10 per person or a full bar for $20 per person. Please let me know if you would like to explore these options.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,
