Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to cater your event.  

For this occasion, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing is set at $50 per person, and this includes VAT. We recommend catering for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages for an additional fee, or you may opt to arrange your own bar service. We also cater to dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points. Is there flexibility in the menu offerings? We are expecting around 150 guests, but that number might fluctuate, so would you be able to adjust the final price if we end up with fewer guests?  

Also, could you confirm if the $50 per person covers all aspects of the meal, including setup and staffing? I appreciate the kosher option, but can you specify what kind of meat dishes will be included?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I completely understand your concerns. For the menu, we can provide a selection of dishes such as grilled chicken, beef brisket, and roasted vegetables. If your guest count changes, we can adjust the final price accordingly, although the per person rate remains the same.  

The $50 per person does include setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the day of the event. We can also accommodate additional dietary requests with prior notice. If you have specific dishes in mind, please share, and we will do our best to include them.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward.  

Best,
