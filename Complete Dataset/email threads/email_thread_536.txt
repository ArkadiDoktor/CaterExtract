Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering for this event. We specialize in a variety of menu options, including meat and dairy, and can accommodate dietary restrictions as needed.  

Our pricing typically ranges from $40 to $60 per person, depending on the menu selections you choose. We can discuss a more tailored proposal once we finalize the details. Please let me know the expected number of guests, as we can cater for a minimum of 50 up to a maximum of 150 participants.  

All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that they meet the highest standards. We do not include a bar service in our standard packages, but we can arrange beverages separately if desired.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information regarding the menu options. We anticipate around 100 guests for the retreat. Could you provide a few examples of dishes included in your mixed menu? Additionally, I would like to confirm whether the pricing you mentioned includes VAT or if that would be added on top.  

If possible, could you also clarify the cancellation terms? We want to ensure everything is in order.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. For your event, we can offer a selection of dishes such as herb-marinated chicken, roasted vegetable platters, and various salads. Our pricing of $50 per person does include VAT, so there won’t be any additional charges in that regard.  

As for cancellation, we require at least two weeks' notice before the event to avoid any cancellation fees. This allows us to adjust our preparations accordingly.  

Please let me know if you need any more information or if you would like to proceed with the arrangements.  

Best,
