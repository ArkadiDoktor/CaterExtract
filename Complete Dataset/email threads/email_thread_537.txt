Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming conference on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. We specialize in offering a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, which can cater to various dietary preferences.  

For your event, we can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, and this includes VAT. We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring adherence to dietary laws.  

In addition to the food, we can arrange for beverages; however, please note that a full bar service is not included in the base price. We will also handle the setup and staffing for the event, ensuring everything is ready before your guests arrive.  

I would be happy to discuss specific menu highlights and any dietary accommodations you may need. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to proceed with a proposal.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the initial details. The price per person sounds reasonable, but I was hoping we could consider a fixed price for the total catering service to simplify budgeting. Additionally, can you clarify what the minimum and maximum number of guests would mean for the final cost?  

I appreciate that you offer kosher options, but could you provide some examples of the dishes available? We are also considering including a bar service if possible, even if it means adjusting the price.  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your desire for a fixed price arrangement. For your event, if we set the total price at $6,750, that would cover 150 guests and include all the services outlined, with kosher supervision. This price includes VAT. If you have a lower count, we can adjust the total accordingly.  

As for the menu, we can offer items like herb-roasted chicken, vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads. We can also include soft drinks in the base package, but for a full bar, we would need to discuss additional costs based on your preferences.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I’ll be happy to accommodate any specific requests.  

Warm regards,
