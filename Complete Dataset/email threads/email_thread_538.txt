Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event, accommodating between 100 to 150 guests. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes a diverse menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Additionally, we can offer a kosher menu supervised by the Orthodox Union to ensure the highest standards.  

The package includes appetizers like smoked salmon canapés, a main course of herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of gourmet desserts. We can also provide a full bar service for an additional fee. Please note that our prices are exclusive of VAT, which is applicable at the standard rate.  

To secure your booking, we typically require a 20% deposit, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than two weeks prior to the event. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to discuss further details.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds wonderful, especially the smoked salmon canapés. However, I would like to clarify a few points before making a decision.  

Could you confirm if the $45 per person rate includes VAT, or will that be added on top? Additionally, we may have some guests requiring vegetarian options, so I would appreciate any suggestions you have for accommodating them. Finally, could you provide details about the bar service? Is it included in the base price, or would that be an extra cost?  

Thanks for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person rate does not include VAT, which will be added to your final invoice. Regarding dietary options, we can certainly accommodate vegetarian preferences with dishes like a roasted vegetable tart and a quinoa salad.  

As for the bar service, it is not included in the base price. We can offer a full bar package starting at $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and cocktails. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this option or if you have any other questions.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.
