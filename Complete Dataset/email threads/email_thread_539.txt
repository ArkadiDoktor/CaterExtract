Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on October 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater what promises to be a beautiful celebration.  

Our catering packages typically start at $50 per person, which includes a selection of mixed appetizers, a main course, and dessert. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and all prices include VAT. Additionally, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary needs are met.  

We can also provide a selection of beverages, though our packages do not include a full bar service. If you have specific menu preferences or dietary restrictions, please let us know, and we can tailor our offerings accordingly.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the details you provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate the per-person rate, especially if we end up with closer to 150 guests. Is there any flexibility for larger groups?  

Also, can you provide a couple of example dishes you might suggest for the main course? I want to ensure we have a good mix that caters to various tastes.  

I appreciate your help and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For a guest list of 150, I can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person. In terms of main course options, we have a delicious herb-crusted chicken, a savory roasted vegetable lasagna, and a honey-glazed salmon that have all been crowd favorites.  

Please let me know if this works for your budget. We can finalize the menu and other details once we agree on pricing.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for adjusting the rate. I’d like to proceed with the $45 per person for 150 guests, which brings the total to $6,750, including VAT. I appreciate the main course options you provided and think they will appeal to our guests.  

Can you please confirm that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we cancel at least two weeks in advance? If everything looks good, I will send over the deposit to secure our date.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best regards,
