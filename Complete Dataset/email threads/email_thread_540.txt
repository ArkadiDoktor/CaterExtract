Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Catering. We are excited about the opportunity to cater your upcoming gala dinner on June 15th. Our team specializes in creating memorable culinary experiences, and we would be thrilled to contribute to your event.  

We offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options, ensuring that we can accommodate a variety of dietary preferences. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT, which will be added on top.  

For your event, we can manage between 50 to 150 guests, and we ensure that all food served is kosher, under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. We can also provide a bar service for an additional fee, if you wish.  

Could you please confirm if you have any specific menu items in mind or any dietary accommodations we should consider? I look forward to your reply.  

Best regards,  
Katherine Levy

Hi Katherine,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to confirm the inclusion of a bar service, but I am concerned about the overall cost, especially since we might have closer to 120 guests. Would you be open to adjusting the price per person or offering a package deal?  

Additionally, we would prefer a menu that highlights some traditional dishes, perhaps lamb and a vegetarian option. Could you confirm whether the VAT is included in the final price?  

Looking forward to your revised proposal.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and feedback. I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. For a group of 120 guests, I can offer a package deal at $70 per person, which will include the bar service at a flat rate of $1,200. The total will then be $8,400, excluding VAT.  

Our menu can certainly include traditional lamb dishes along with a robust vegetarian selection, such as stuffed peppers and roasted vegetable platters. All food will be kosher, with supervision from the local Kashrut authority as previously mentioned.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you. I’m eager to finalize the details and ensure everything aligns with your vision for the event.  

Warm regards,

Hi Katherine,  

Thank you for your revised proposal. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the pricing. I am happy to proceed with the offer of $8,400 for 120 guests, including the bar service. Please confirm that the total includes VAT, and send over the contract.  

In terms of dietary accommodations, we will need to ensure there are gluten-free options available for a couple of our guests. If you can confirm these details, I will consider the agreement settled.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.
