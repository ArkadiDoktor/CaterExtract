Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you provided. I appreciate the flexibility in your menu options. I’m particularly interested in the mixed menu, as we have some attendees with different dietary needs.  

Could you clarify if the $45 per person includes VAT, and would you be able to offer a selection of beverages as well? If not, could you provide a separate pricing option for a bar? Also, could you confirm the cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person does not include VAT, which will be added on top. Unfortunately, our standard package does not include a bar, but I can provide a beverage package for an additional $15 per person, which includes soft drinks and juices.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event date for a full refund. Please let me know if these adjustments work for you, and I can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the additional information. I would like to proceed with the mixed menu at $45 per person, plus the beverage package for $15, totaling $60 per person. Therefore, for 100 guests, the total would be $6,000. Please confirm that this includes kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

I understand the cancellation policy, and I appreciate your flexibility. Let’s move forward with this arrangement.  

Best regards,
