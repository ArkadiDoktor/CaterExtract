Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming bridal shower on October 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making this event memorable. Our specialty is providing a diverse menu that includes a range of options to accommodate different dietary preferences.

For the bridal shower, we typically recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing structure is based on a per person rate of 45 dollars, which includes all food and service. We can cater for a minimum of 30 guests and a maximum of 100 guests. Please note that our prices include VAT, and we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council of New York.

We also offer a selection of beverages, though a full bar would be an additional charge. Our team is experienced in handling setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the day of the event. If you have any specific requests for menu items or dietary needs, please let us know.

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the price per person you've quoted. However, given our budget constraints, is there any flexibility to bring that down to 40 dollars per person? We expect around 40 guests, so that would make a significant difference.  

Additionally, could you confirm if the menu you proposed includes any vegan options? Since we have a few guests with dietary restrictions, it would be great to ensure everyone is accommodated.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

I completely understand your budget considerations and would like to accommodate your request. We can adjust the price to 40 dollars per person, which would total 1,600 dollars for the estimated 40 guests. This price still includes VAT and all services provided. 

As for the menu, I can certainly add a couple of vegan options alongside our vegetarian choices. Popular dishes like stuffed bell peppers and roasted vegetable platters have been well-received in the past. 

Please confirm if this arrangement works for you, and I will prepare a formal agreement.
