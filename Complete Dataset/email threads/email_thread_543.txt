Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our menu can be tailored to your needs, offering a range of options, including meat, dairy, and mixed dishes.  

We typically charge $50 per person, which includes setup and staffing. Our services can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests, and all prices include VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union if that is a requirement for your event. Please let us know if you would like to include beverages, as they are not part of the standard package.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt reply. I appreciate the flexibility in your menu options. Since we expect around 150 guests, the pricing seems reasonable. However, could you confirm whether the $50 per person includes a variety of dietary accommodations? We have a few guests with dietary restrictions, and it would be helpful to know what can be offered.  

Also, we are considering serving wine and soft drinks at the event. Could you provide an estimate for including a bar service?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear that the pricing aligns with your expectations. We can certainly accommodate dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, without any additional charge.  

Regarding the bar service, we can provide a selection of wines and soft drinks for an additional $15 per person. If you decide to go with the full catering package for 150 guests, the total would amount to $65 per person, which includes everything.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,
