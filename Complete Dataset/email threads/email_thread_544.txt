Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events like yours, and we would be delighted to assist you.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and vegetarian options. We pride ourselves on accommodating different dietary restrictions, so we can provide gluten-free and vegan options as well. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes all necessary staffing and equipment for setup. Please note that this price does not include beverages, as we prefer to allow clients to choose their own beverage service.  

We can comfortably cater to a minimum of 50 guests and we can handle up to 150. Our meals are under strict kosher supervision by the Rabbinical Council of America, ensuring that they meet all necessary dietary laws. VAT will be included in the final price.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or if you have any additional questions.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

I appreciate your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a couple of points before moving forward. Is it possible to include a bar service as well? We are expecting around 100 guests, and I want to ensure that we have a full-service experience for them. Additionally, if we decide to adjust the guest count later, what are your cancellation terms?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. We can certainly offer bar service at an additional cost of $15 per person, which would include a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Regarding the guest count, we can adjust up to one week before the event without any cancellation fees, but if the count changes after that, we would need to charge for the originally agreed minimum of 50 guests.  

If you would still like to proceed with the initial catering package for 100 guests, the final price would be $4,500, including VAT but excluding the bar service. Please let me know if this works for you.

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I would like to confirm the catering for 100 guests at the price of $4,500, along with the bar service for an additional $1,500. This brings our total to $6,000. Please prepare the contract accordingly, and we can finalize everything once I review it.  

Thank you for your assistance, and I’m looking forward to working with you.
