Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this occasion.  

We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing generally starts at 45 dollars per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

As for dietary restrictions, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request. Additionally, we have kosher meals available under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please let us know if you're interested in including beverages or a bar service, as they would be priced separately.

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would you be open to considering a fixed price for 100 guests? Additionally, could you confirm if the beverages would include soft drinks or if those are also priced separately?  

I look forward to hearing back from you.  

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding the budget. For a fixed price for 100 guests, we can offer a total of 4,500 dollars, which includes VAT and a selection of soft drinks. Please note that this pricing covers our standard menu, which includes items like grilled chicken skewers, a variety of salads, and dessert platters.  

Regarding the bar, we can certainly arrange for that as well, but it would be an additional cost. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for adjusting the offer. The fixed price of 4,500 dollars for 100 guests works perfectly for us, and I appreciate that it includes the soft drinks. I would like to proceed with this arrangement and confirm that we will need kosher catering under Orthodox Union supervision.  

Please send over the contract, including the cancellation policy, and any other details we need to finalize. Looking forward to making this event successful with your help.
