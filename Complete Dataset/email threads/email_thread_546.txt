Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We are excited about the possibility of catering for your event. Our services can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests, and we offer a range of menu options to suit various dietary preferences including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

We typically charge $35 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing. Please note that this price does not include beverages, but we can provide a bar service at an additional cost. If you decide to proceed, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Please let me know if you have any specific menu items in mind or if you would like to see some of our popular dishes. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Matthew,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm whether the $35 per person includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, we are considering including a beverage package, so could you provide more information on the cost and options for that?  

I appreciate your mention of kosher supervision. That is essential for us. Could you also share some specific menu highlights that would be available for a mixed meal style?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

I appreciate your questions. The pricing of $35 per person does include VAT. For the beverage package, we offer several options starting at $15 per person, which includes soft drinks, wine, and beer.  

As for the menu, I can suggest items like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and assorted kosher desserts. We can accommodate both meat and dairy preferences, ensuring all meals are kosher under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,

Hi Matthew,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing and beverage options. I would like to go ahead with your proposal for 75 guests at $35 per person, with the beverage package included at $15 per person. This brings the total to $3,750, and I understand that this includes VAT.  

Please confirm the menu selections we discussed, and let me know if everything is set for the event on November 15th. I would also appreciate having your cancellation policy for our records.  

Thank you, and I look forward to working together.  

Best wishes,
