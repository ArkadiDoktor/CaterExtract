Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you are looking for a catering service for the gala event on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special occasion.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed selections, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the menu choices and the number of guests. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and up to 200.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to discuss menu options in more detail.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm excited about the potential collaboration. I noticed the price range you provided. Could you clarify whether that includes VAT or if it's added on top? Additionally, we are anticipating around 150 guests, and I’d like to explore a mixed menu with some vegetarian options included.  

Also, can you confirm if beverages will be part of the package, or will they be separate?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final invoice. For the mixed menu, we can certainly accommodate vegan and vegetarian options along with meat dishes.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our packages, but I can provide a separate quote if you're interested. If we proceed with 150 guests and a mixed menu, I can offer a final price of $65 per person, inclusive of dietary accommodations.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you need further adjustments.  

Best,
