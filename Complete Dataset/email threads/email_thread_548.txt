Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events like yours and would love to help make it a success.  

Our catering services can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and we offer a variety of menu options. For a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options, we typically charge $45 per person. This price includes VAT and covers appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We also provide a selection of beverages, but please let us know if you require a full bar service for the event.  

All our meals can be prepared as kosher under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. We can also cater to specific dietary requirements, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or need additional information.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify if the $45 per person includes both the bar service and staff for setup and service during the event.  

Additionally, could you provide a couple of examples of the dishes you would recommend for a mixed menu? I’m also interested in the cancellation policy in case our guest count changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person does not include a full bar service; that would be an additional $15 per person if you choose to include it. Staff for setup and service is included in the original price.  

For the mixed menu, I recommend our grilled salmon with a lemon dill sauce, along with a stuffed chicken breast featuring spinach and feta. For vegetarian options, our roasted vegetable lasagna is always a hit.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to two weeks before the event date for a full refund. After that, there may be a fee depending on the timing.  

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to proceed with the booking.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I would like to proceed with the booking for 100 guests at $45 per person, which includes the setup and service. We will not require the bar service at this time. Please consider this email as confirmation of the catering order, and I’ll ensure to inform you of any changes no later than two weeks before the event.  

Looking forward to working with you to make this event a success.
