Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I was wondering if you could offer a fixed price for the entire event instead of a per-person basis. We are expecting around 150 guests, and I would like to keep our budget in check. Also, could you clarify whether the beverage package includes alcoholic options?  

We want to ensure that all our attendees' dietary preferences are accommodated, particularly vegetarian options. I appreciate your help in making this a successful event.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your concerns about budgeting. For a fixed price, we could offer £4,200 for 150 guests, which includes a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a dessert bar. This price also includes VAT. As for the beverages, we can include a selection of soft drinks and juices, but alcoholic beverages would be an additional cost.  

We are happy to accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options as well. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
