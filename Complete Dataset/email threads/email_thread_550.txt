Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our menu focuses on a mixed selection that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring a delightful experience for all your guests. 

For pricing, we typically charge $75 per person, and this includes all food and setup. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Our meals are kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union. We can also offer a range of beverages, but please let me know if you require a full bar service as that would be an additional cost. 

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I would be happy to adjust the menu accordingly. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to confirm that the $75 per person price includes VAT, correct? Additionally, could you clarify if the beverages you mentioned would include soft drinks and juices or if they are strictly for a wine and beer selection? 

We are expecting around 100 guests, so I would like to ensure that the pricing remains within our budget. If we decide to go with the full bar, what would be the estimated additional cost? Finally, could you provide some examples of the menu items included?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. Yes, the $75 per person does include VAT. For the beverage options, we typically provide a selection of soft drinks and juices included in the package, but full bar service would be an additional $15 per person. With 100 guests, that would bring the total to $90 per person if you choose the full bar.

As for the menu, we can offer items such as herb-roasted chicken, stuffed peppers, and a variety of salads. We’re also happy to accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian requests. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.
