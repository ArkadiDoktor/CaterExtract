Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15. We would love to provide catering for your event. Our team specializes in a variety of menu options, and we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy dishes.  

For your event, we suggest a price of $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Our pricing includes VAT, and we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the local Rabbinical Council.  

Beverages are not included in the initial price, but we can arrange for a bar service at an additional cost. Please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions, and we will do our best to accommodate them.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed proposal. The price point is a bit higher than we had initially budgeted, but I appreciate the quality of service you offer. Would it be possible to negotiate the price to $40 per person? Also, we anticipate around 100 guests, but I need confirmation before we finalize.  

I’m pleased to hear that you can provide kosher options. Can you specify what kinds of dishes you might include? Additionally, we are considering a self-service beverage station instead of a full bar to keep costs down.  

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand the budget constraints and am willing to accommodate your request. I can adjust the price to $40 per person for 100 guests, which would bring the total to $4,000. This price includes VAT and the kosher options.  

For the menu, we can offer items such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads and desserts. We can also set up a self-service beverage station, which will help in reducing costs.  

Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks prior to the event. Let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the arrangements.  

Best,
