Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your event on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services. Based on our previous conversations, we understand you are planning a wedding reception for approximately 100 guests. We offer a variety of menu options, including mixed dishes to accommodate different dietary preferences.  

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, with a minimum requirement of 50 guests. This includes all food preparation and service staff. Please note that we would need to add VAT on top of this price.  

Additionally, our meals are kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union. We also offer a selection of beverages and can include a full bar if desired.

Hi Mike,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The $75 per person price seems reasonable, but I would like to explore a few adjustments. We are considering a guest list that could range from 80 to 120 people, depending on final RSVPs. Could you confirm if the pricing remains consistent within that range?  

I would also appreciate it if you could provide a few examples of the dishes included in your mixed menu, as well as any options for dietary accommodations. Lastly, could you clarify if the VAT is included in the $75 price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. The pricing will remain at $75 per person for any guest count between 80 and 120, so there will be no additional charges within that range. The VAT will be added on top of this price.  

As for the menu, we offer a variety of options including beef brisket, roasted vegetables, and an assortment of salads. We can also accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free requests. If you’re interested in the full bar option, I can send over the beverage list as well.  

Please let me know if you have any further questions or specific requests.

Hi Mike,  

Thank you for the detailed information. I appreciate the pricing clarity and menu options. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at the agreed price of $75 per person, which brings us to a total of $7,500 before VAT. Please confirm that this includes setup and service staff for our event.  

I understand the cancellation policy is typically 30 days prior, so I will keep that in mind as we finalize our plans. I look forward to working with you to make this event special.
