Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing seems reasonable, but given our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a fixed price for 100 guests? Additionally, could you clarify whether the meals are kosher and if you provide bar service? We want to ensure everything aligns with our event requirements.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For a fixed price for 100 guests, we can offer $4,000, which includes all meals and service staff. Yes, our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can certainly provide a bar service at an additional cost if you choose.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
