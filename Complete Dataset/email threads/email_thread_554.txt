Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Bella's Catering for your upcoming gala event on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services for events similar to yours.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of meat and dairy dishes, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, and this includes a range of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, all crafted to meet your guests' varying dietary needs. We can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options as well.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include bar services in our standard package, but we can arrange for that separately if desired. Each package includes setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly from start to finish.  

Please let me know your expected number of guests, and if you have any specific menu preferences, I would be happy to customize our offerings to suit your needs.  

Best regards,  
Lisa Thompson

Hi Lisa,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the options you provided. We are expecting around 150 guests, but it could go up to 200, depending on final RSVPs.  

While the $45 per person pricing is appealing, could you offer a package that includes beverages? Additionally, could you clarify if VAT is included in that price? I want to ensure we stay within our budget.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply and for providing the guest estimate. I can offer a beverage package for an additional $15 per person, which would include a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Regarding your question about VAT, the price of $45 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

If you confirm 150 guests, the total would be $6,750 plus VAT, and if you decide to include the beverage package, it would come to $9,000 plus VAT. If you have any other requests or preferences, please let me know.  

Best wishes,
