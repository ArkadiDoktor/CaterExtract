We can serve between 100 and 150 guests, and our dishes can be prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Rabbinical Council of America. Additionally, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, which can be customized based on your preferences.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I am particularly interested in the mixed menu you mentioned. However, I was hoping to clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT or if that would be an additional charge. Additionally, can we discuss options for a bar service as well, as I would like to include beverages for our guests?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person price does include VAT, so there are no hidden fees. Regarding the bar service, we can definitely provide a package that includes a selection of wines and cocktails for an additional $25 per person. This would bring the total to $100 per person if you choose to include the bar.  

If you would like to proceed, we can finalize the menu options as well as any dietary accommodations you may require. Please let me know how you would like to move forward.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing and the VAT inclusion. After discussing with my fiancé, we would like to move forward with the $100 per person option, which includes the bar service. We would also like to finalize the menu with a focus on vegetarian options alongside the meat selections. Please send over the final contract and any other details we need to complete.  

Best regards,
