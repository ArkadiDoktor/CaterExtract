Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights. We would be delighted to cater your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for April 15th. Our team specializes in creating memorable dining experiences, and we can provide a menu that suits your guests' diverse tastes.  

For events like yours, we typically recommend a mixed menu, featuring options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and I want to confirm that our offerings are kosher, supervised by the OK.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary options to consider, and whether you would like us to include beverages or a bar service in your package. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
James Thompson

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound great, and I appreciate the details on the pricing. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit, as our budget is somewhat tighter than initially anticipated. Would you be able to offer a lower rate if we finalize the agreement soon? We also need to clarify that the beverage service will be separate from the catering package.  

Could you also confirm if VAT is included in the price, and what your cancellation policy entails?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand the need to stay within budget. After reviewing, I can offer a revised rate of $70 per person if we confirm the booking by the end of this week. VAT is included in this price. Regarding cancellation, we allow cancellations up to one week before the event with a full refund.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the details about dietary accommodations and menu finalization.  

Best,
