Dear Lisa,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making your special day memorable with our culinary offerings.

Our catering service provides a range of menu options, including a mixed menu that features meat, dairy, and pareve dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union. For your event, we recommend a selection of appetizers, a main course featuring herb-crusted salmon and a vegetarian option, and a dessert bar with assorted pastries.

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $75, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Beverages can be arranged but are not included in this package. If you'd like, we can discuss options for a bar setup as well.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss menu specifics or have any dietary accommodations we should consider.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, especially the herb-crusted salmon. I appreciate the kosher supervision details as well.

Before we proceed, could you confirm if the $75 per person includes everything we discussed, or if there are additional costs we should anticipate? Additionally, we are expecting around 100 guests but might have the option to increase that number. Can you provide a quote for 100 guests, and what the cancellation policy looks like?

I look forward to your clarification.

Dear Lisa,

Thank you for your prompt reply. I'm glad to hear you're excited about the menu! The price of $75 per person does indeed include all the items mentioned, along with VAT. For 100 guests, the total would be $7,500. 

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a minimum of two weeks' notice for cancellations, after which a fee may apply based on the total estimated cost. If you need any adjustments to the menu or have specific dietary requests, please let me know, and I can tailor the offerings accordingly.

Looking forward to finalizing the details with you.

Warm regards,
