Dear Sarah,  

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would be delighted to assist.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring delightful dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet desserts. Our pricing structure operates on a per-person basis, and we typically recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. The price per person is $45, which includes VAT.  

We can also offer kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. Additionally, we can provide beverage service for an extra charge if you’re interested. Please let me know if you would like to discuss any particular dietary requirements or if you have any other questions.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds excellent, and I appreciate the kosher options you can provide. However, I would like to clarify a couple of points before moving forward.  

While I understand the price per person is $45, our guest count may fluctuate, so could you confirm if there’s flexibility on the minimum guest count? Also, given that we expect a mix of dietary needs, can you accommodate vegan and gluten-free options as well?  

Lastly, could you provide more details regarding the beverage service? I’m considering either a full bar or just soft drinks.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly accommodate fewer than 50 guests if needed; we can discuss a fixed total of $2,250 for a group of 50, which allows us to cover all essential services. For larger groups, we can still maintain the $45 per person rate.  

Regarding dietary needs, we can offer vegan and gluten-free options alongside our standard menu. As for the beverage service, we can provide a full bar for an additional $1,500 or a soft drink package at $500. Please let me know your preference.  

I look forward to your thoughts so we can finalize the details.  

Best,  
Emily

Thank you for clarifying everything. I appreciate your flexibility with the guest count and the dietary accommodations. I would like to confirm the catering for 50 guests at the fixed price of $2,250, including the full bar service.  

I understand the cancellation policy is within 14 days prior to the event, which works for us. Please proceed with the arrangements, and let me know if you need any additional information from my end.  

Looking forward to the delicious experience you will provide.
