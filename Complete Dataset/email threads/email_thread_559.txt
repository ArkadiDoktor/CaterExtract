Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist in catering this special event. Our services can accommodate a range of 50 to 150 guests. We offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, and we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal with an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Beverages can be arranged separately, depending on your requirements. We also ensure that all dietary restrictions are considered, so please let us know if any guests require special accommodations.  

If you would like to proceed, please share any specific preferences you have for the menu, and I can send over some suggested items. We typically require a 20% deposit to secure the booking, with a cancellation policy allowing for a full refund up to two weeks prior to the event.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The gala dinner sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the range of options you provide. I would like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly, can you confirm if the $75 per person price includes VAT? Additionally, we are considering a bar for the evening. Would you be able to offer a drinks package, or is that something we need to arrange separately?  

I look forward to your reply so we can finalize our plans.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top. Regarding the bar, we can certainly provide a drinks package, which would range from $20 to $30 per person depending on the selection of beverages you choose.  

If you would like to include the bar in your package, I can provide a more detailed breakdown. Please let me know if you need any adjustments to the menu or other services.  

Best wishes,
