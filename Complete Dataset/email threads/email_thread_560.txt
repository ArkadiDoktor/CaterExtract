Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our catering packages start at $50 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 and 200 guests.  

We offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, and we can prepare kosher meals under the supervision of the Star-K certification. Please note that beverages are not included in the base pricing but can be added to your package as needed.  

All prices mentioned are inclusive of VAT. We can also cater to various dietary requirements, so please let us know if any guests have specific needs. Once we finalize the details, we will provide a comprehensive menu that includes highlights such as roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and a selection of desserts.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in the price per person, especially for larger groups. Additionally, could you confirm the cancellation policy in case we need to make changes as the event date approaches?  

We are expecting around 150 guests, and I want to ensure the menu can accommodate both kosher and non-kosher dietary preferences. Also, could you clarify if the drinks provided can include both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options?  

Best regards,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For a group of 150 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person. Our standard cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event without penalties. After that, a charge of 50% of the total will apply.  

As for beverages, we can provide a full bar package that includes both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options for an additional fee. I will ensure that we can accommodate all dietary preferences, including kosher meals as previously mentioned.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu details.  

Best,
