Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event. Our menu features a delightful selection of mixed dishes, including both meat and vegetarian options, ensuring that all guests have ample choices.  

For pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes a full buffet setup and a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that all prices include VAT.  

In terms of dietary concerns, we can offer options for gluten-free and vegetarian guests. Our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. However, we do not include a bar service in our standard package, but we can discuss adding that at an additional cost.  

If you would like to proceed, please let me know, and I can send over a detailed menu for your review.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The $45 per person price is reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit on that, especially if we confirm the maximum number of 150 guests. Additionally, could you clarify whether the VAT is included in that price?  

I appreciate the kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and it’s great to hear you can accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian options. However, I’m interested in knowing if there are any specific menu highlights you would recommend for this type of event.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the importance of budget considerations for such an event. I can offer a revised price of $40 per person if we confirm 150 guests. To clarify, VAT is included in that price.  

For menu highlights, I would recommend our roasted salmon with dill sauce, as well as our herb-crusted beef tenderloin, both of which have been popular in past events. We can also provide a selection of gourmet salads and desserts to complement the main dishes.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the details.  

Best regards,
