We offer a diverse menu that includes meat and dairy options, and all our meals are kosher, supervised under the Orthodox Union.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing sounds reasonable, and I appreciate your kosher supervision under the Orthodox Union. However, I wanted to clarify if the beverage selection can be included in the base package for our estimated 100 guests, or if we need to choose from a specific range of drinks.  

Additionally, we are interested in accommodating some dietary restrictions, particularly vegetarian and gluten-free options. Could you provide more details on what you can offer in that regard?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can certainly include a limited selection of beverages in the package for your 100 guests. This will consist of soft drinks, water, and coffee. We can also accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free requests, offering a couple of options for each guest type.  

If you decide to go with our services, I can confirm the total cost would be $3,500, which covers everything discussed so far. As for cancellation, we require at least two weeks' notice for any changes. Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any other adjustments you'd like to make.  

Best regards,  
David
