Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu tailored to suit various dietary needs, and I believe we can create an exceptional experience for your guests. 

For this event, we suggest a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options to accommodate all preferences. Our pricing structure is set at $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 200. 

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, certified by the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can offer a selection of beverages, although a full bar would need to be arranged separately. 

If you have any specific dishes in mind or further dietary requirements, please let me know. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to confirm that we will indeed be having around 150 guests. 

Could you clarify if the $50 per person includes the beverages you mentioned? We would like to keep everything within a reasonable budget, so if we could adjust the menu to include some simpler options or perhaps reduce the price to $45 per person, that would be ideal. 

Also, could you provide a bit more information about the types of dishes you would recommend?  

Thank you,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I’m happy to confirm the price of $45 per person, which would include a selection of our more popular dishes. This adjusted price would still incorporate VAT. The beverage selection can be included for this rate, but I recommend considering a separate bar service if you want a wider variety of options. 

For menu highlights, I would suggest our herb-marinated chicken, roasted veggies, and a mouthwatering chocolate mousse for dessert. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let me know if there are any specific needs. 

Regarding cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event to avoid any charges. I hope this works for you.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility and the menu suggestions. I’d like to move forward with the proposal at $45 per person, including the selected beverages for 150 guests. 

Please confirm that we will have kosher supervision as discussed, and I’ll ensure to communicate any dietary restrictions as soon as possible. I appreciate your clarification on the cancellation policy as well. 

Looking forward to finalizing the details.
