Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making this event memorable.  

We specialize in a variety of menu options and can accommodate both kosher and non-kosher selections. Our offerings include a mixed menu featuring gourmet dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of artisan breads. We can also provide vegetarian options and are happy to discuss any specific dietary needs your guests may have.  

For pricing, we typically charge $55 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing. This price is inclusive of VAT. We can comfortably serve a minimum of 30 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests if your attendance grows.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you provided. The menu sounds great, especially the herb-crusted chicken. I appreciate that you offer accommodations for dietary needs as well.  

Would it be possible to adjust the pricing if we anticipate around 100 guests? Additionally, could you confirm whether the kosher meals are under reliable supervision? We want to ensure everything aligns with our guests’ preferences. If we could also explore the option of including beverages, I would like to know how that affects the overall cost.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. For 100 guests, the price would remain at $55 per person, which would total $5,500. Our kosher meals are supervised by the local Orthodox Union, ensuring that they meet the highest standards of kosher compliance.  

As for beverages, we can include a bar package for an additional $15 per person, which covers a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Let me know if you would like to proceed with this option.  

I look forward to your decision.  

Best regards,
