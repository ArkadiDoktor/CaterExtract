Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering options for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu tailored to fit various dietary needs. Our offerings include both meat and dairy dishes, ensuring a delightful experience for all your guests.  

We typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person for events of this nature, which includes setup, staff, and equipment. This pricing is based on a minimum of 50 guests, and we can accommodate up to 200. Please note that VAT is included in the stated price.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under strict rabbinical supervision if required. We can also offer a variety of beverages, including a full bar, at an additional cost.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a couple of things. We expect around 150 guests, and I appreciate that the price includes VAT. Would you be able to slightly adjust the price to $70 per person?  

Also, can you confirm the types of kosher supervision available? It’s essential for us to ensure all dietary restrictions are met. I look forward to your feedback.

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. While our standard rate is $75 per person, I can offer $72 per person for the 150 guests with the same level of service and menu selection.  

Regarding kosher supervision, we work closely with a local rabbi who ensures all preparations meet kosher standards. This includes a variety of options that cater to different dietary needs, such as vegetarian and gluten-free choices.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am happy to accept your proposal of $72 per person for our event on March 15th, which will be for 150 guests. Please prepare a mix of meat and dairy options, ensuring that kosher supervision is maintained.  

I understand the cancellation policy is flexible up to two weeks before the event, which works for us. Let’s finalize the details regarding the menu highlights and beverage options soon.  

Looking forward to working together on this event.
