Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate conference on June 15th. We specialize in creating delicious and memorable dining experiences, and I would love to help you with your event.  

For a gathering of between 50 to 150 guests, we offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. This price covers a complete meal with appetizers, main courses, desserts, and beverages. We can accommodate special dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your quick response. I appreciate the information you've provided. I would like to know if you can also offer kosher options, as we have a few guests who follow dietary restrictions. Additionally, could you clarify whether the beverages included are non-alcoholic or if there is an option for a bar service?  

I’m also wondering if there is room for negotiation on the price if we exceed the minimum guest count. I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear from you again. We can certainly provide kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary requirements are met. Regarding beverages, our standard package includes non-alcoholic drinks, but we can add a bar service upon request for an additional charge.  

As for pricing, if your guest list exceeds 100 people, I can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person for the additional guests. Please let me know if that works for you, and I can send you the detailed menu options.  

Looking forward to your thoughts,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I would like to proceed with the kosher menu for 120 guests at the rate of $40 per person. This brings the total to $4,800, which I understand includes VAT. Please confirm if this includes the setup and staffing as well. I would appreciate receiving the detailed menu options at your earliest convenience.  

Lastly, could you outline the cancellation policy? I look forward to finalizing this arrangement.  

Best regards,
