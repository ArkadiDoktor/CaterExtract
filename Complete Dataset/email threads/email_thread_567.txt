Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision provided. However, I would like to clarify whether the $75 per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top.  

Additionally, we are considering around 100 guests, and I am interested in discussing some dietary accommodations. Are you able to provide vegetarian and gluten-free options?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Rebecca,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person does include VAT, so there won't be any additional charges there. We are more than happy to accommodate dietary needs; we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request.  

If you decide to move forward, we can finalize the menu and any additional details, including whether you'd like to include a bar. Please let me know your thoughts so we can ensure everything is set for your wedding.
