Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for November 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our specialty is providing a diverse menu that accommodates various dietary requirements.

For this particular event, we recommend a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of artisan breads. We can also offer vegetarian and gluten-free alternatives if needed. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes all food and service for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT.

Regarding dietary accommodations, we do offer kosher options that are supervised by the local rabbinical council. However, please let us know if you would like to include a bar service, as it is not included in the standard package.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Hi James,

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the proposed menu. I appreciate the flexibility with dietary options. However, I would like to inquire if there's any room for negotiation on the per-person price. Since we are expecting around 75 guests, I was wondering if you could offer a slightly reduced rate. 

Additionally, could you confirm whether the quoted price includes VAT, and if not, what that additional cost might be? 

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your follow-up. I understand your concern regarding pricing. I can offer a reduced rate of $42 per person if you confirm the booking for 75 guests. To clarify, VAT is not included in the initial quote, so please factor in an additional 20%. 

I'm glad you are considering our kosher options; we can include those in the package. As for beverages, we can arrange a bar service at an additional cost of $15 per person if you’re interested.

Please let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare a formal agreement.

Best,

We would like to include the kosher menu options as discussed. Additionally, please provide the details for the bar service, as I think that would enhance our event. 

Also, could you send over the cancellation policy at your earliest convenience? 

Looking forward to your confirmation.
