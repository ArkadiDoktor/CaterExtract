Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. The menu sounds great, but I was hoping to explore a slightly lower price point if possible, as we have a few other costs to consider. Would you be able to offer a price reduction if we can confirm the guest count at around 70? Additionally, could you please confirm if the food is kosher and under which supervision?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Lisa,  

Thank you for your response and for clarifying your guest count. I can reduce the price to $70 per person for 70 guests. Regarding the kosher status, we ensure all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can arrange for a beverage service if you're interested.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this revised proposal.  

Warm regards,
