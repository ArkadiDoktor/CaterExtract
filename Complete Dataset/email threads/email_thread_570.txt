Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th at the Grand Hotel. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our menu offers a range of options, including meat, dairy, and pareve dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. We can accommodate anywhere from 50 to 200 guests.  

Our pricing structure is set at $60 per person, which includes VAT. This would cover a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, along with standard setup and staffing. However, please note that beverages and bar services would be available at an additional cost.  

If you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, do let me know, and we can customize the menu accordingly. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and detailed proposal. The gala dinner is indeed an important event for us, and we appreciate your offerings.  

I wanted to clarify a few points before we proceed. Would you be able to offer a slightly reduced price for a guest count closer to 150? Also, could you confirm if the $60 per person includes everything as stated, or if the bar service will significantly increase the final price?  

Additionally, we have several guests with dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian options. Would you be able to accommodate those as part of the menu?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up and understand the importance of accommodating your guests' needs. For a guest count of 150, I can offer a revised rate of $55 per person, which still includes VAT. As for the bar service, we can discuss options that best fit your budget, as it will be an additional cost depending on the selection you choose.  

We can certainly provide gluten-free and vegetarian options within the menu. Some of the representative dishes we offer include herb-roasted chicken, quinoa salad, and a variety of seasonal vegetables.  

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and we can finalize the details.
