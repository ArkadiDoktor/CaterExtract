Dear Clara,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your event on November 15th. We specialize in a variety of menus and can accommodate both large and small gatherings. Based on your requirements, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $45, which includes VAT. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Also, we ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Please let us know if you'd like to include beverages, as that can be arranged at an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the details you provided. The per-person rate seems reasonable, but I was hoping to get the pricing down to around $40 per person. Is there any flexibility on that? Additionally, could you provide a sample menu? I want to ensure we have options for guests with dietary restrictions, particularly vegetarian and gluten-free choices.  

I’m also considering whether to include a bar service. If we decide to go with your proposal, when would be the latest we could cancel without a penalty?  

Thanks again, and I look forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Clara,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budgetary concerns. I can adjust the pricing to $42 per person if that helps. Our sample menu includes items like grilled chicken skewers, vegetable lasagna, and a selection of gourmet salads. For dietary restrictions, we can ensure that we have vegetarian and gluten-free options available.  

As for the bar service, we can offer a package at an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. Regarding cancellation, you can cancel without penalty up to seven days before the event.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
