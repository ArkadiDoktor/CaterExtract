Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would love the opportunity to cater this event for you. Our offerings include a variety of menu options, which can be tailored to meet your specific needs.

We typically charge $45 per person and can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150. Our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. We can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, and we can also accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free requests.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further. I can send over a sample menu as well as additional details regarding setup and staffing.

Looking forward to your response.

Dear David,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I’m wondering if there is any room for negotiation on the price per person, as we are working with a limited budget for this event.

Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are included in the pricing, or if that would be an additional cost? It would be great to see your sample menu so we can make an informed decision.

Thanks again for your help.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your response. I understand budget constraints, and I can offer a revised rate of $42 per person if we confirm the booking by the end of next week. Beverages, including soft drinks and wine, will be an additional cost, but I can provide a package that fits your needs if you’re interested.

I will send over the sample menu shortly. It will include a variety of options, such as roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and a selection of desserts, all prepared under kosher supervision.

Let me know if this works for you.

Best,
