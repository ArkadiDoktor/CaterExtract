Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your catering needs. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for various events, and I believe we can create a wonderful menu for your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and vegetarian options to accommodate all guests. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. This price includes VAT, and we can provide a selection of kosher food under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Additionally, we can arrange for a bar service, but it would be an extra charge. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages as well.  

I look forward to your feedback.  

Best,  
Jonathan Reed

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, but I would like to clarify a few points. Would it be possible to accommodate a few dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free and vegan options?  

Also, regarding the bar service, can you provide a separate quote for that? I would appreciate it if you could confirm the final price for 100 guests, including any additional costs associated with the bar.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. We can indeed accommodate gluten-free and vegan requests within our mixed menu. For the bar service, I can provide a package for an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

For 100 guests, the total would be $6,000, which encompasses the $45 per person for the mixed menu and an additional $1,500 for the bar service. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for cancellations up to seven days before the event for a full refund.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare the final agreement.
