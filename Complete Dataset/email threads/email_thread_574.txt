Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in catering events like yours and can provide a diverse menu tailored to your needs.  

For a gathering of between 50 to 150 guests, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Our offerings can be customized to include kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.  

Please let me know if you’re interested, and we can discuss the menu in more detail, including any specific preferences you may have.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining your services. I appreciate the flexibility in menu options. Before we proceed, I wanted to clarify whether the $45 per person includes VAT or if it would be added later. Additionally, could you provide more details about the bar service? We have a budget for drinks that we need to consider.  

Lastly, while I understand the menu can be customized, could you suggest a few highlights to help us finalize our decision?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person does include VAT, so there won’t be any surprises there. Regarding the bar, we can offer a cash bar service, or if you prefer, we can include a limited selection of wines and beers for an additional $15 per person.  

As for the menu, I recommend our herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet desserts, which have proven to be crowd favorites. Let me know if this sounds good, and I can prepare a more detailed proposal for you.  

Best,
