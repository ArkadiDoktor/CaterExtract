Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making this event memorable. Our team specializes in a variety of cuisines, and we can accommodate both formal and casual settings.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options such as roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and seasonal salads. We can also provide a selection of desserts. Please note that our pricing includes VAT, and we can offer kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Additionally, we can arrange for a bar service, but it would be at an additional cost. We are also equipped to handle various dietary requirements, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

If you have specific menu items in mind or other preferences, please let me know, and I will provide a detailed proposal.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and for outlining your catering options. The menu sounds appealing, especially the roasted chicken and vegetarian lasagna. However, since we expect around 120 guests, I'm wondering if there is any flexibility in your pricing, particularly if we finalize the details soon.  

Also, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the per-person price, or is it strictly extra? We are considering a full bar, and it would help to know the cost implications.  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. For a confirmed guest count of 120, I can offer a slight reduction to $70 per person, which would bring the total to $8,400. The bar service would be an additional $2,500 for a full bar, inclusive of all beverages.  

Regarding the kosher options, we can provide a fully kosher menu if needed, and the supervision can be arranged with the rabbinical authority that we regularly work with. Please let me know if you have any specific dishes or dietary accommodations you’d like us to incorporate.  

Once we finalize the agreement, I can send over the cancellation terms, which typically allow for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.
