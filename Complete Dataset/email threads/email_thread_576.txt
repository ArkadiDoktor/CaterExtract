Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to discuss catering options for your upcoming gala on March 15th. We specialize in high-end events and can offer a diverse menu tailored to your needs. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on your selection of dishes.  

We can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision by the ORB. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and up to 250 guests, ensuring that all dietary restrictions are respected. Additionally, we can supply beverages, but please note that a bar service would be an extra cost.  

If you have a specific menu in mind or need suggestions, I would be happy to provide some highlights. Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed an important event for us, and we want to make sure everything is perfect. I appreciate the mixed menu option and the kosher supervision details. Could you clarify if the pricing you mentioned includes VAT or if it would be added on top?  

Also, if we were to go with the maximum of 250 guests, could you provide a few sample menu items? Lastly, what are your cancellation terms?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The pricing I provided does not include VAT, which would be added to the final invoice. For a guest count of 250, I would recommend highlights such as herb-crusted roast beef, a selection of gourmet salads, and a delightful assortment of desserts, including flourless chocolate cake.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund. I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed and finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
