Dear Rebecca,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala on December 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our team specializes in a variety of cuisines, and we can accommodate both meat and dairy dishes. We can offer a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal, appetizers, and dessert.  

We are equipped to serve between 100 to 200 guests, and our pricing does include VAT. We can also provide a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary needs are met. Additionally, we can arrange for a full bar service, but please let us know if that is required.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a few points. We are expecting around 150 guests, and I would like to confirm if the price of $75 per person includes beverages or if that is an additional cost.  

It’s important for us to accommodate various dietary restrictions, so could you let me know what options you have available? Also, what are your cancellation terms in case our plans change?  

Thank you again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Rebecca,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $75 per person pricing does not include beverages, but we can offer a bar package for an additional $20 per person if you're interested. Regarding dietary accommodations, we can provide vegetarian, gluten-free, and nut-free options to ensure all guests are catered for.  

As for our cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to proceed.
