Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming Annual Charity Gala on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you on this special event.  

We can provide a mixed menu that offers a variety of options to accommodate different dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free choices. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

For the gala, we typically charge a fixed price of $85 per person, which includes VAT. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests and can accommodate up to 250. This package includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Additionally, we can provide beverages for an extra fee if you are interested.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,  
Michael Cohen

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, our budget is a bit tighter than anticipated. Would you be open to negotiating the price per person? If we could get it down to $75, we would be able to move forward with up to 200 guests.  

Also, I wanted to clarify if the $85 includes any bar services or if that is separate.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I completely understand your budget constraints. I can adjust the price to $80 per person for the gala, which would still allow us to deliver a quality dining experience. This price will include the VAT but does not cover bar services; those would need to be arranged separately.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a more detailed menu proposal.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for adjusting the price; $80 per person works for us. We will proceed with 200 guests, and I will arrange for the bar services separately. I appreciate your flexibility and professionalism. Please confirm the final details and any necessary next steps on your end, including cancellation terms.  

Looking forward to a successful partnership.
