Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding celebration on June 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special occasion. Our team specializes in a variety of menu options, including a delicious mixed menu that features both meat and dairy dishes.  

For pricing, we generally charge $75 per person, which includes a full buffet with appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This pricing also includes VAT, so there won’t be any hidden costs. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and I assure you we can tailor our offerings to meet any dietary restrictions your guests may have, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

If you're interested, I can send over a sample menu and discuss any specific preferences you might have. Please let me know if you would like to proceed.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the proposal. I appreciate the detail you provided. I would love to see the sample menu you mentioned. Additionally, could you confirm whether the food is kosher? My family has specific dietary needs, and it’s essential for us to ensure the food meets those standards.  

Also, I am curious about the cancellation policy in case our guest count changes or we need to make adjustments.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah Thompson

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear from you again. Our catering is indeed kosher, supervised by the local Orthodox community, ensuring everything complies with dietary laws.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to two weeks before the event date with a full refund, which can provide some peace of mind given the uncertainties of planning.  

I will send you a sample menu shortly. Just to clarify, our pricing covers the food and setup, but beverages and bar services would be additional if you’re interested in that as well.  

Best,
