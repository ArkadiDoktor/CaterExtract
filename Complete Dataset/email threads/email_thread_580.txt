Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, but I would like to confirm whether your offerings are kosher and under what supervision. This is crucial for our attendees. Additionally, could we discuss the possibility of including a bar option?  

If we go ahead with 80 guests, could you provide a breakdown of the total cost, including any additional options? Also, I would appreciate knowing your cancellation policy in case of any unforeseen changes.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. Yes, our menu is kosher and under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Regarding the bar, we can offer a package for an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

For 80 guests, the total would be $4,800, which includes VAT. As for cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund.  

Let me know if you would like to proceed or if there are any further adjustments you would like to make.  

Warm regards,
