Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on February 15th. We would love to cater this event for you. Our team specializes in mixed menu options, and we can offer a selection of delicious dishes, including herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads.  

For events of this nature, we typically charge a fixed price of $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and we are happy to provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific dietary accommodations or if beverages and bar services are needed. Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I was hoping to clarify whether the bar service would be included in the per-person price or if it would be an additional cost. Our guest list is currently at around 80 people, but it may grow, so I would like to know the maximum number you could accommodate without changing the price.  

I am also interested in any vegetarian options you might offer. Once I have these details, I can proceed with the planning.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The bar service would indeed be an additional cost, typically around $15 per person for a full bar selection. We can comfortably accommodate up to 150 guests, and the price remains fixed as long as the number of attendees does not exceed that.  

As for vegetarian options, we can certainly include dishes like stuffed bell peppers and a quinoa salad. Please let me know if you would like to finalize the arrangements based on this information.  

Best,  
David

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I would like to confirm our catering arrangement for 80 guests at the fixed price of $45 per person, which brings the total to $3,600. I understand the bar service will be an additional $15 per person, which I will include in our budget.  

Please note that we may require some dietary accommodations for a few guests, particularly regarding vegetarian options. I appreciate your assistance, and I look forward to working with you.  

Best regards,  
Sarah
