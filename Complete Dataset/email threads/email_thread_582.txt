Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to various events and would be delighted to assist you.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Our pricing is structured at twenty-five dollars per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate a minimum of fifty guests and a maximum of two hundred. Please note that this price is inclusive of VAT.  

If you would like, we can also offer a kosher option under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. Additionally, we can provide a beverage bar for an extra cost.  

Do let me know your event date and any dietary requirements you might have, and I can provide a more detailed proposal.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The event is scheduled for March 15, and we expect around one hundred guests. I appreciate the details you provided, especially regarding the mixed menu.  

Could you clarify if the kosher meals are available for all menu items? We have a few guests with dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Additionally, how flexible are you with the pricing if we decide to increase the guest count?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for the additional details. Yes, all menu items can be prepared kosher, and we offer vegetarian and gluten-free options as well. If your guest count increases to one hundred fifty, we can maintain the price of twenty-five dollars per person, but for two hundred guests, we would need to adjust it to twenty-two dollars per person.  

The cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event. I hope this addresses your concerns. Please let me know if there’s anything else you need.  

Best,
