Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds wonderful, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points. We are expecting around 100 guests, and while I appreciate the pricing structure, is there any room for negotiation on the per-person cost? Additionally, could you confirm whether the $75 price includes VAT?  

We are also considering including a bar service, so if you could provide details on your beverage options and pricing, that would be great.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,  
Rachel

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person for a guest count of 100, with VAT included in this price. Regarding the bar service, we can provide a full bar package for an additional $30 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

Please let me know if this meets your needs or if there are any additional adjustments you'd like to discuss.
