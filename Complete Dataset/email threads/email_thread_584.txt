Dear Rachel,

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide our services for this special event. We specialize in creating exquisite dining experiences and can offer a diverse menu tailored to your needs.

For a formal sit-down dinner, we can provide a mixed menu featuring options like herb-crusted beef, grilled salmon, and a variety of vegetarian dishes. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, and we recommend a minimum of 100 guests to ensure a vibrant atmosphere. This price includes VAT and all necessary equipment for setup.

We can also accommodate dietary restrictions and provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council. However, please note that beverages, including a bar, are not included in this price, but we can arrange those services as well.

I would be happy to discuss this further and answer any questions you may have.

Best regards,

Hi Ethan,

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu options sound fantastic, and we appreciate the inclusion of kosher meals. However, I wanted to clarify if there’s any flexibility with the pricing, especially if we end up having around 150 guests.

Additionally, could you confirm the cancellation policy? In case of any changes, we want to ensure we understand our options.

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Rachel,

I appreciate your quick follow-up. For a guest count of 150, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person. Regarding cancellation, we typically require a 30-day notice for a full refund. Any cancellations made within that window will incur a 50% fee.

Please let me know if this works for you, and I would be delighted to finalize the details.

Warm regards,
