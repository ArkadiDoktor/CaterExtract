Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services for events like yours and would love to partner with you.  

Our menu features a mixed selection of dishes, including gourmet meat and vegetarian options. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan choices. Our pricing is set at £45 per person, and we can cater for a minimum of 100 guests and up to 200 guests. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide a full bar service for an additional £15 per person. We also offer kosher catering under the supervision of the London Beth Din, ensuring all dietary laws are strictly followed.  

If you would like to discuss this further or have specific requirements, please feel free to reach out.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I'm very interested in your services, especially the kosher options. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of details.  

Would you be able to adjust the pricing if we decide to go with an estimated 150 guests? Also, while I appreciate the bar service, we are currently considering providing our own beverages, so could you confirm if that would affect the overall pricing?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,  
Jessica Taylor

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your reply and for considering our catering services. If you decide to go with 150 guests, we can indeed offer a revised price of £42 per person, which would come to a total of £6,300. If you choose not to include the bar service, we can maintain the same per-person rate without any additional charges for that aspect.  

In terms of setup, we will ensure that our staff arrives two hours before the event starts to handle everything smoothly. Please let me know if you have any other questions or adjustments in mind.  

Best regards,
