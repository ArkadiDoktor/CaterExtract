Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for March 15. We would be thrilled to provide our catering services for this special occasion.

We specialize in creating exquisite menus tailored to your needs. Our typical offerings include a mix of meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OU. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing starts at $75 per person, inclusive of VAT. This price includes a three-course meal featuring items like herb-roasted chicken and a rich chocolate mousse.

If you are interested in a beverage package, we can discuss that as well. I look forward to hearing from you soon to finalize the details.

Warm regards,  
Julia Cohen

Hi Julia,

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The menu sounds delicious, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details. However, I wanted to inquire if you could offer a slightly lower price per person, perhaps around $65, considering our budget constraints.

Additionally, could you confirm if the beverage package is included in the initial quote? We are expecting about 100 guests, and I would love to know more about any available dietary accommodations for some of our guests who have specific needs.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of staying within budget, and I can adjust the pricing to $68 per person while still providing our complete service, including the three-course meal and VAT. The beverage package is not included in the initial quote, but we can offer a selection of drinks for an additional $15 per person.

We can certainly accommodate dietary needs, such as gluten-free or vegetarian options. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I will be happy to prepare a finalized agreement.

Best regards,

Hi Julia,

Thank you for your flexibility on the pricing. I would like to proceed with the $68 per person for 100 guests, confirming the three-course meal with the dietary accommodations. We will also need the beverage package at $15 per person.

This brings the total to $8,300, which I am happy to accept. Please send over the final agreement, including cancellation terms, so we can finalize everything.

Thank you for your assistance.

Warm regards,
