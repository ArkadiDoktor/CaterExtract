Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming gala on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special event. Our team specializes in elegant gatherings, and we have a diverse menu that can cater to various dietary needs.  

For a formal sit-down dinner, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of vegetarian dishes. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and our pricing includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbi, ensuring they meet all necessary requirements. We also offer a full bar package as an addition. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific requirements.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The menu options sound great. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of points. For our gala, we are expecting around 150 guests, and I’d like to know if we could adjust the price to $65 per person while maintaining the quality of the menu you suggested. Also, could you confirm if the bar services are included in that price?  

We are particularly interested in offering a mixed menu along with accommodations for vegetarian and gluten-free options, as we have a few guests with dietary restrictions. Please let me know if adjustments can be made.  

Best,  
Rachel

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate your interest in our services. While I can’t reduce the price to $65 per person, I can offer the original menu at $70 per person for 150 guests, which would total $10,500. This price would still include VAT and the full bar service as an additional option.  

We can certainly include vegetarian and gluten-free choices in the menu. As for the cancellation policy, we typically require a notice of two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of the deposit. Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.
