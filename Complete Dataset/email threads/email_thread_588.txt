Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I wanted to clarify whether the $50 per person includes VAT or if it will be added later. We're looking at around 150 guests and would prefer a mixed menu that includes options for both meat and dairy. Additionally, do you provide beverages or is that something we need to arrange separately?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $50 per person does not include VAT, which is charged at the standard rate. We can certainly offer a mixed menu, and I can include popular items like herb-roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and seasonal salads.  

As for beverages, we do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can arrange a drinks service for an additional $15 per person, which would cover soft drinks and wine. Please let me know if that works for you, and I’ll prepare a revised quote.  

Best wishes,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to proceed with the initial offer of $50 per person for 150 guests, including the mixed menu options you mentioned. Please include the drinks service for an additional $15 per person, bringing the total to $9,750. I appreciate that the VAT will be added separately.  

Could you also confirm the cancellation policy for this agreement? I look forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
