Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would love to be part of your special day.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our packages start at £40 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests, and the pricing includes VAT.  

Regarding dietary needs, we are happy to provide options for gluten-free and vegan guests. Our food is kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages in the package or if you prefer a separate arrangement for a bar.  

I look forward to your response so we can discuss your vision for the menu in more detail.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm excited about the options you provided. For our guest count, we expect around 120 people, and I appreciate the flexibility on dietary accommodations.  

However, I was hoping to get a more detailed breakdown of the menu items you offer, especially any signature dishes you recommend. Additionally, could you clarify if the £40 per person includes beverages? If not, what would the cost be to add a bar service?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly provide more details on the menu. Some of our popular dishes include herb-roasted chicken, a rich vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads.  

The £40 per person does not include bar service; that would be an additional £15 per person, which covers a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. We can adjust the menu and pricing depending on your final guest count and any specific preferences you have in mind.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,

I look forward to finalizing this and working together to make our reception memorable.
