Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering options for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for December 10th. We specialize in providing a diverse range of menu choices, including kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we typically cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. Beyond the meal, we can also offer a selection of beverages, but that would be an additional cost.  

Some of our popular menu items include herb-roasted chicken, quinoa salad, and assorted pastries. We are happy to accommodate dietary restrictions as needed. Please let me know your preferences, and we can customize the menu accordingly.  

Looking forward to your thoughts!  

Best regards,  
Michael Cohen

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. The menu options sound great, particularly the herb-roasted chicken. However, we may have around 80 guests attending, and I wanted to confirm if you can handle that number comfortably.  

Additionally, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes beverages, or should I expect a separate charge for that? I would also appreciate it if you could send over the cancellation terms in case our plans change.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. Yes, we can certainly accommodate 80 guests without any issues. Regarding the beverages, the $45 per person covers the meal only, with drinks being charged separately. Our beverage packages start at $15 per person.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund. I hope this helps clarify things! Please let me know if you’d like to move forward or if you have further questions.  

Best,
