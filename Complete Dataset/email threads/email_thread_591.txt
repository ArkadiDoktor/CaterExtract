Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your event on October 15th. We have extensive experience with corporate gatherings, and I believe we can provide a menu that suits your needs.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, we typically charge between $45 and $60 per person, depending on the menu selections. Our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can offer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options.  

The pricing includes VAT, and while we do not provide a bar service, we can recommend some excellent beverage options if needed. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions as required.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu preferences in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. I have a few questions regarding the pricing. If we were to finalize for 75 guests, would you be able to offer a fixed price instead of the range? Also, could you provide some examples of the menu items included?  

We want to ensure that the menu is both appealing and accommodating for various dietary needs. If possible, could you also confirm your cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah Mitchell

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up questions. For a confirmed guest count of 75, I can offer a fixed price of $50 per person, which brings the total to $3,750. The menu can feature items like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can certainly accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options as well.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to five days before the event for a full refund. After that, a 50% fee applies.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
