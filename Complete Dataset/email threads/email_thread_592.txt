Dear Lisa,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your catering needs for the upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide our services for this special occasion. Based on the details you shared, I recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, which can accommodate various dietary requirements.  

Our pricing structure is $45 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. This price includes VAT and covers a selection of delicious dishes, such as roasted chicken with herbs, a variety of seasonal vegetables, and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert. We can also offer vegetarian options for those who request them.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any specific menu items or have any questions about our services.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the mixed menu option, as it will cater to diverse preferences. However, I would like to clarify if the $45 per person price includes beverages, or if those are separate. Additionally, our guest list may reach around 200 people, so would you be able to accommodate that number, and what would be the adjusted price?  

Lastly, could you confirm if your food is kosher and the supervision under which it is prepared?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Lisa,  

I appreciate your questions and your interest in our services. The $45 per person does not include beverages, but we can provide a bar package at an additional cost, if you're interested. For a guest count of 200, the adjusted price would be $40 per person, as we can offer you a bulk discount.  

I can also confirm that our meals are kosher and are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We can offer a variety of dietary accommodations, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and if you would like to proceed with this revised proposal.  

Warm regards,

Thank you for your clarification and the revised pricing. I’m pleased to confirm that we will proceed with the catering at $40 per person for 200 guests. I appreciate your commitment to providing kosher meals and accommodating dietary needs. Please prepare a menu that highlights the roasted chicken and chocolate mousse, as those sound particularly appealing.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, could you please provide that detail? Additionally, I would like to discuss the setup and staffing arrangements closer to the date.  

Thanks again for your assistance!
