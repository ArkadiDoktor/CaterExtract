Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming conference on March 15th. We would be thrilled to provide catering services for your event, which I understand will have around 150 attendees.  

We specialize in a mixed menu, featuring both meat and vegetarian options, and can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan choices. Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $45 per person, inclusive of VAT, which will cover a full buffet service along with setup and staffing.  

For the menu, I suggest highlights such as herb-roasted chicken, quinoa salads, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can also discuss beverage options, as we typically offer a separate bar service.  

Please let me know if you would like to explore this further or if there are specific preferences you would like to discuss.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your detailed proposal. The menu options sound delightful, and I appreciate the inclusive pricing. However, I was wondering if you could offer any flexibility on the price, especially since we are expecting between 120 and 200 guests. Would you consider a range in pricing if we adjust the guest count?  

Additionally, could you clarify whether your menu is kosher, and if so, under what supervision? It is important for us to ensure that all dietary needs are met.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I understand your concerns regarding pricing, and I can offer a price adjustment based on your guest count. If you can confirm a minimum of 150 guests, I can reduce the cost to $40 per person.  

Regarding kosher supervision, all our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council of Greater Washington. We can certainly accommodate your dietary requirements, including gluten-free options. However, please note that our standard package does not include a bar service, which can be arranged at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I would be happy to finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the updated offer. The revised price of $40 per person works for us, and I appreciate the kosher certification details. I’d like to confirm the catering for 150 guests, which brings the total to $6,000, and we will handle the bar service separately.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience along with the cancellation policy. We’re excited to partner with Gourmet Delights for our event!
