Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights Catering. We are excited to assist you with the food arrangements for your upcoming wedding ceremony scheduled for April 15th. We specialize in creating memorable culinary experiences, and I would be happy to provide you with a proposal tailored to your needs.  

For your event, we offer a variety of menu options, including mixed dishes that can accommodate a range of dietary preferences. Our standard pricing starts at $50 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 120 guests. This price includes VAT and covers both the food and service staff for the event.  

We do take dietary restrictions seriously and can provide vegetarian, gluten-free, and kosher options under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. Would you like to include a beverage service, or would you prefer to handle that separately?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Emma,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposal sounds promising, especially the mixed menu options. However, I noticed the starting price of $50 per person. Is there any flexibility on this? We are expecting around 75 guests, and I would like to see if we can negotiate a lower rate.  

Additionally, could you clarify if the kosher meals would be strictly meat or if dairy options are also available? I would prefer to have a well-rounded selection to cater to different tastes.  

I look forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the importance of balancing quality and budget. For your event, I can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person if you confirm a guest count of at least 75. Regarding the kosher meals, we can provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options while adhering to kosher guidelines.  

Please note that our beverage service, including wine and soft drinks, is not included in the initial pricing but can be added for an additional $15 per person. Let me know if that works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Emma,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I would like to proceed with the $45 per person rate for 75 guests, confirming the total price of $3,375. Please ensure that the kosher meals are prepared under the supervision of the local authority, and I would appreciate it if the menu includes a variety of both meat and dairy dishes.  

I am also interested in adding the beverage service, so please include that in the final agreement. I understand your cancellation policy requires notice at least two weeks in advance, which is acceptable.  

Let’s finalize everything so we can move forward.  

Best regards,
