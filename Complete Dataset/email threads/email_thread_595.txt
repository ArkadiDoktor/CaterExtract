Dear David,  

Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the information you've provided. We are expecting around 100 guests, but we may adjust that number depending on final RSVPs. I would like to confirm that the pricing you mentioned includes VAT.  

Additionally, we are looking for a mixed menu that accommodates various dietary needs, including vegetarian options. If you could provide a sample menu that highlights your recommended dishes, that would be helpful. Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in your pricing?  

Looking forward to your response.

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I can certainly provide a sample menu featuring a mix of meat and dairy options, including vegetarian dishes. Our standard pricing does indeed include VAT, and we can offer a final price of $65 per person for your event, which would include an assortment of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, with options for those with dietary restrictions.  

Regarding beverages, our packages do not include a bar; however, we can arrange for beverage service at an additional cost if that interests you. Please let me know if you'd like to see some beverage options as well.  

Best regards,
