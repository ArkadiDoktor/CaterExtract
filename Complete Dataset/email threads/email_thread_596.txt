Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on April 15th. We are delighted to have the opportunity to cater this special event. Our standard catering package includes a selection of gourmet dishes, and we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. 

Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. All of our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a variety of dietary accommodations upon request. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages, as our packages do not typically cover bar services.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your quick response. The menu sounds great, but I was hoping we could adjust the price slightly. Given our budget constraints, would you be open to discussing a fixed rate of $40 per person? Also, we will need to finalize the details regarding beverage options soon. Could you provide more information on what you could offer?

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your response and understand the need to work within your budget. I can accommodate the rate of $40 per person for a minimum of 50 guests, and I’ll include a selection of non-alcoholic beverages in that price. If you would like to include a full bar, we could explore options that would be available for an additional fee. 

Please confirm if this meets your requirements, and I will prepare a detailed menu for your review.

Warm regards,
