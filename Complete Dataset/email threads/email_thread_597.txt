Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Delish Catering for your upcoming corporate gala on April 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to provide our services for your event.  

For a gathering of this nature, we recommend our mixed menu, featuring a selection of gourmet meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing is structured at $80 per person, and this includes setup, service staff, and all necessary equipment. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and I want to assure you that we can provide gluten-free and vegetarian options as well.  

Additionally, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Please note that our pricing does not include beverages, but we can arrange a bar service if desired. VAT is included in the quoted price.  

I look forward to your feedback so we can discuss this further.  

Best regards,  
David Green

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but I wonder if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we finalize the number of guests closer to the date. Would you be able to provide a discount if we were to confirm a minimum of 150 guests? Also, could you clarify the cancellation terms?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest and your questions. If we can secure 150 guests, I can offer a revised rate of $75 per person, which would bring the total to $11,250. As for cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event to avoid any cancellation fees.  

We’ll also ensure that the dietary accommodations are clearly marked on the buffet for your guests. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the details.  

Best regards,
