Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping we could negotiate a bit since we are expecting around 150 guests. Would you be able to offer a fixed price for our event? Additionally, can you clarify if the $50 per person includes VAT? 

I appreciate that the food is kosher, but could you specify the supervision details? We want to ensure everything aligns with our requirements. Also, could you detail the menu highlights you might suggest for a mixed menu? 

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback on the proposal. For a fixed price, I can offer $7,000 for 150 guests, which includes VAT. Our kosher supervision is through the Orthodox Union, ensuring all standards are upheld. 

For a mixed menu, I would recommend our herb-marinated grilled chicken, roasted vegetable platter, and a selection of dairy desserts. We can also provide gluten-free options if needed. Regarding beverages, we can include soft drinks, but any alcoholic beverages would still be charged separately. 

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the arrangements.
