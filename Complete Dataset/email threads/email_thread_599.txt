Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We are delighted at the opportunity to assist you with this special occasion. Our catering services offer a range of options to suit various preferences, including meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For a wedding of your size, we typically recommend a package priced at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and dessert. This rate covers a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please note that prices do not include VAT, which will be added to the final invoice.  

Additionally, we can offer a range of beverages, though a full bar would need to be arranged separately. We are happy to cater to any dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

If you have a specific menu in mind or if you would like to discuss this further, please let me know.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, but I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Our guest list is likely to be closer to 80 people, and we're looking for something that might offer a few more options without breaking the bank. Would you be open to exploring a package priced around $65 per person instead?  

Also, could you please confirm whether the $75 pricing includes VAT, or will that be added later? We are also considering whether we want a bar service, so it would be helpful to know the costs involved there as well.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and completely understand the desire to manage costs. I can offer you a revised package at $70 per person, which will still provide a variety of delicious options while ensuring quality. This includes VAT, so there won't be any surprises later.  

As for the bar service, we can arrange a cash bar for $15 per person or a full open bar for $25 per person, should you decide to include that. Please let me know if this works for your budget, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your revised offer. I think the $70 per person package works for us, and I’d like to go ahead with that. We will also consider the cash bar option, so please include that in the final agreement.  

Could you please confirm that the menu will feature a mix of meat and dairy dishes, as well as provide options for vegetarian guests? Lastly, I’d like to understand the cancellation policy before we finalize everything.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
