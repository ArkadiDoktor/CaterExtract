Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your wedding on December 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We would be delighted to assist you in making this special day memorable.  

We specialize in a diverse array of menu options, and for your event, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, and this includes all necessary setup and service staff. We typically accommodate events for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

All our food is kosher, supervised under the Star-K certification. Please note that we do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can certainly arrange one for an additional charge. We can also accommodate common dietary restrictions, ensuring that your guests have suitable options.  

I would be happy to send over a sample menu and discuss any specific requests you might have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but we are trying to manage our budget closely. Would you be able to offer a slightly lower rate, perhaps around $65 per person? Additionally, we are considering a guest list that might reach closer to 180, so we would need to confirm if that could be accommodated within your services.  

I appreciate the kosher certification and the dietary options you mentioned. Could you also clarify if VAT is included in the quoted price?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the importance of staying within budget. While I can reduce the price to $70 per person, we would still need to maintain the minimum of 50 guests. Unfortunately, we can only accommodate a maximum of 150 guests for this event.  

As for the VAT, it is included in the price I quoted. If you decide to proceed, we can finalize the menu and additional arrangements such as a bar service.  

Please let me know how you would like to move forward.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your flexibility. After discussing with my team, we have decided to move forward with your offer of $70 per person for 150 guests. We appreciate the inclusion of VAT and the kosher supervision. Please prepare a contract outlining the details, including the menu options and cancellation policy, for our review.  

We will also need to discuss the bar service as we finalize everything. Looking forward to your response.  

Best,
