Hi David,

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety you offer, especially the kosher options. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to lower the per-person rate to $40? 

Also, could you clarify if the bar services are included in that price or if it would be an additional cost? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Rachel,

I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. While we typically maintain our pricing at $45 per person due to the quality of ingredients and service, I can offer a package at $40 per person if you can confirm a minimum of 75 guests. 

Regarding the bar, it is indeed an additional cost, but I can provide a selection of beverages at a competitive rate if you decide to go forward with the catering. 

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.

Best,
