Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us about catering for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15. We would be delighted to assist you in making your event a success. Our services include a diverse selection of dishes tailored to your guests' preferences.  

We typically offer a mixed menu featuring meat and vegetarian options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. For this particular event, we can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT. This package does not include a bar, but we can arrange beverage services separately if needed.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or if you have any dietary requirements to consider.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. The mixed menu sounds perfect, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I would like to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to reduce the price to $65 per person if we finalize the guest count by next week?  

Additionally, it would be helpful to know if you offer any specific dishes that are popular among guests with dietary restrictions, as we may have some attendees who are gluten-free.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your consideration and the opportunity to work together. I can agree to the $65 per person rate if we can confirm a minimum of 100 guests. Regarding dietary restrictions, we do offer gluten-free options like quinoa salad and grilled vegetables, which have been well-received in the past.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu and logistics. Just a reminder, our cancellation policy allows for changes up to one week before the event without penalty.  

Warm regards,
