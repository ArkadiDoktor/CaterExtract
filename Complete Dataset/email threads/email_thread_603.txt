Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event. Our standard offering includes a range of delicious options tailored to a professional atmosphere, and we specialize in a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For a guest count between 50 and 100 attendees, our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can provide a selection of dishes, such as grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, quinoa salad, and a choice of desserts. Additionally, we can offer kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical council, if that is required.  

Please let me know if you have specific preferences or any questions about our offerings. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding the menu options. I appreciate the flexibility in accommodating dietary needs. However, I noticed that the price per person might be a bit higher than we budgeted for. Would you be open to discussing a fixed price for the entire event, perhaps with a cap at 80 guests?  

Also, could you clarify if beverages or a bar service are included in that price? We are considering whether to include that in our overall budget.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for getting back to me. I understand your concerns regarding the budget. We can offer a fixed price of $3,600 for up to 80 guests, which brings the per-person cost down to $45. This price includes a basic beverage service, but a full bar would be an additional charge.  

Regarding the menu, we can certainly provide kosher options under the same supervision, and we can also accommodate specific dietary requests upon advance notice. Please let me know if this works for you or if you need any further adjustments.  

Best wishes,
