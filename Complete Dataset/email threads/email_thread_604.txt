Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event. We are excited about the opportunity to cater for your gathering, which I understand will be a wedding reception. Our catering services can accommodate anywhere from 50 to 150 guests, and we offer a variety of menu options that can be tailored to your needs.

For our wedding packages, we typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Additionally, we provide staff for setup and serving. All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision from the local rabbinical authority, and we offer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options. 

Please let me know if you have specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I can provide more details. I look forward to discussing this further.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The fixed price of $75 per person sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify if the price includes VAT or if that will be added on top. Also, we are expecting around 100 guests, and I want to ensure that there are options for vegan attendees as well.

Additionally, could you confirm whether beverages are included in the package? I’d appreciate any representative menu items you can provide so we can make an informed decision. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thanks for your follow-up. The price of $75 per person does include VAT, so no additional charges will be applied. We can certainly accommodate vegan dietary options alongside our standard menu. 

Regarding beverages, our package does not include a bar, but we can offer a selection of non-alcoholic drinks as part of the meal. As for menu highlights, I recommend our herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable platter, and an assortment of gourmet desserts.

If you confirm the 100 guests, the total would come to $7,500. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and if you have any further questions.

Best wishes,
