Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate seminar on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event.  

We specialize in offering a range of menu options, including both meat and dairy selections, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK. Our pricing starts at $35 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests if needed.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or any dietary accommodations that your attendees might require. Additionally, we can provide beverages and staffing for an extra fee, but these are not included in the base price.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining your offerings. The $35 per person price point sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to explore some flexibility, as we might be expecting closer to 200 attendees. Could we discuss options for a fixed price per event if we reach that number?  

I also want to ensure that the menu includes a good variety for different dietary needs, as we may have some vegetarian attendees. Could you provide a sample menu and confirm if the pricing includes VAT?  

Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,  
Jessica

Dear Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need for flexibility. If we accommodate up to 200 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $6,500, which would include the full menu and VAT. We can definitely include a vegetarian option along with our standard offerings, which typically consist of chicken, beef, and fish dishes.  

For beverages, we can create a custom package based on your preferences. Please let me know if that works for you, and I will prepare a sample menu for your review.  

Thanks again for considering us for your event.  

Warm regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your revised offer and for providing details about the menu and pricing. The fixed price of $6,500 for 200 guests works perfectly for us, and I appreciate the inclusion of the vegetarian options. Please proceed with preparing a sample menu, and we will finalize the details soon.  

I also want to confirm that we will require setup assistance and that we will be able to cancel up to one week before the event without penalty. Thank you for your understanding.  

Looking forward to your menu proposal.  

Best,
