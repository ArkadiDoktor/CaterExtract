Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event on November 15th. We specialize in catering a variety of events, and I’d love to help you with your needs. For your gathering, we can offer a mixed menu featuring some popular dishes such as grilled chicken, vegetarian pasta, and a selection of salads.  

Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes all food and setup. This price accommodates a minimum of 50 guests and can go up to 150 guests. Please note that VAT is included in this price. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local Rabbinical Council if that is a requirement for your event.  

If you would like beverages or a bar service, we can discuss that as well. Let me know your thoughts, and I will be happy to provide further details or adjustments based on your preferences.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. We’re expecting around 100 guests, and I am particularly interested in the kosher option. However, our budget is a bit tighter than what you quoted. Would it be possible to adjust the price to $40 per person? Additionally, could you clarify if your service includes drinks or if that would be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I completely understand the need to stay within budget. I can offer a reduced price of $40 per person if we limit the menu to three main options, including one vegetarian choice. As for beverages, they are not included in the initial price, but we can provide a beverage package at an additional cost of $10 per person if you decide to include that.  

Please let me know if this works for you. I want to ensure we meet your expectations while staying within your budget.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for working with me on the pricing and menu adjustments. I am happy to accept your offer of $40 per person for the three main options. We will also include the beverage package for an additional $10 per person. This brings our total to $50 per person, which fits our budget perfectly.  

I’ll confirm the final guest count closer to the date, but we will be aiming for around 100. Please prepare the kosher meals according to the Rabbinical Council's standards. I’d also appreciate any additional details regarding setup and staffing for the event.  

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to working together.
