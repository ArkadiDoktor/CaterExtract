Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Jonathan,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on April 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this special event. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can provide a menu that features a selection of both meat and dairy dishes, ensuring that we can accommodate various dietary preferences.

For a gathering of this nature, we usually recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can cater for up to 150. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person basis, with rates starting at $45 per guest. This includes setup and staffing, and we can also provide additional equipment if necessary.

We ensure that all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the local Orthodox Rabbinical Council. Please let us know if you would like to include a beverage package, as that can be arranged separately.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for the quick response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm whether the $45 per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top. Also, we anticipate around 100 guests, but we may need to adjust based on RSVPs. 

Could you provide a sample menu? We want to ensure that there are sufficient options for guests with dietary restrictions, particularly vegetarian and gluten-free.

Thanks again for your help.

Best,

Dear Jonathan,

I appreciate your prompt reply. The $45 per person does include VAT, so there will be no additional charges on that front. I can confirm that we can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options, along with our standard offerings.

As for the menu, I recommend our herb-roasted chicken, a delightful quinoa salad, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can also provide a delicious chocolate mousse for dessert. If you decide to include beverages, we offer a range of wines and soft drinks at an additional cost.

Please let me know if these options work for you or if you would like to explore other menu items. 

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best,
