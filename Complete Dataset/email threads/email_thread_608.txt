Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on November 15. We specialize in providing a range of catering services, and I would be delighted to assist you with this.  

We can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring that we can accommodate a variety of dietary preferences. Our pricing starts at $35 per person, and we require a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150 guests for this event. All prices include VAT, and we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local Rabbinical council.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can arrange for a full beverage service if that is of interest.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further or if you have any specific requirements in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The mixed menu sounds perfect, and I appreciate the inclusion of kosher options. However, I wanted to clarify if the $35 per person covers all food items or if there are additional charges for certain dishes. Also, we might have around 80 guests, so can you confirm if the maximum limit of 150 guests would be a hard cap?  

Lastly, could you provide a few examples of the dishes you typically serve? I’d like to ensure they align with our preferences.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The $35 per person covers our standard menu, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, but there might be additional costs for premium dishes or special requests. The maximum of 150 guests is firm due to our kitchen capacity and staffing constraints, so we can comfortably accommodate your expected 80 guests.  

As for menu highlights, we typically include items like herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads, alongside a dessert bar featuring seasonal treats. We can also discuss dietary accommodations if there are specific needs.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal quote.  

Best,
