Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for considering our services for your upcoming corporate gala on January 15th. We specialize in providing quality catering for events of this nature, and I would be happy to assist you.

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes a diverse selection of dishes, tailored to your preferences. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and I assure you that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. We can offer a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a variety of salads.

Beverages are not included in the base price, but we can certainly provide a bar service at an additional cost. All prices quoted will include VAT, ensuring there are no hidden fees. 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific dietary restrictions to consider.

Best regards,

Hi James,

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The menu sounds promising, particularly the grilled chicken. However, I was hoping to see if we could work within a budget of $65 per person. Additionally, could you confirm if you can accommodate a few vegan options for some of our guests?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your feedback regarding the budget. I can adjust the menu to meet your price point of $65 per person, while still offering a quality selection. We can include a few vegan options such as stuffed bell peppers and a hearty quinoa salad.

With this adjustment, the total cost for 100 guests would be $6,500. Please note that the base price continues to include VAT. If you agree, I can send over a formal contract outlining the details, including our cancellation policy, which allows for a full refund up to a week before the event.

Let me know if this works for you.

Best,
