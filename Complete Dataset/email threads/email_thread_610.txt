Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed proposal. I would like to clarify a few things before moving forward. Can you confirm whether the $50 per person price includes VAT? Additionally, we might have around 130 guests, but we want to ensure we can adjust if more people decide to join us.  

Could you provide a few menu highlights? I’m particularly interested in the meat options. Lastly, do you have any recommendations for bar services if we choose to include them?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $50 per person price does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final total. For your expected 130 guests, we can certainly accommodate that number and adjust if needed up to 150.  

As for the menu, I recommend our grilled chicken with rosemary, beef brisket, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We also have a delicious chocolate mousse that is a crowd favorite. Regarding bar services, we can provide a range of options, including a full open bar or a limited selection, depending on your preferences.  

Please let me know if you would like to finalize the details or if you have further questions.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification and the menu suggestions. I would like to move forward with your catering services for 130 guests at the agreed price of $50 per person, plus VAT, which I understand will be calculated in the final invoice. Please prepare the grilled chicken and beef brisket, along with the mousses for dessert. I would also like to discuss the bar options further.  

I appreciate your assistance, and I look forward to working with you to make this wedding a success.  

Warm regards,
