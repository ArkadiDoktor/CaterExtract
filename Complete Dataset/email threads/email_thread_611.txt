Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for events like yours, and I would be delighted to assist you.  

For a wedding, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of options to cater to different tastes. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which allows for flexibility depending on the number of guests you expect. We generally recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Our rates start at $60 per person, which includes VAT.  

Additionally, we ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. We can also provide a selection of beverages and a bar setup if you wish. Please let me know your guest count and any specific dietary accommodations you might need, and I can provide a more detailed proposal.  

Looking forward to your response!  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. Since we expect around 120 guests, I'd like to confirm the pricing structure. Is the $60 per person the final price, including all services and setup? Additionally, could you clarify the dietary accommodations you offer? We have a few guests with specific needs.  

Also, could we discuss the bar options? I want to ensure we have a good selection of beverages available without it significantly raising the overall cost.  

Thanks for your assistance!  

Best,  
Rachel

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $60 per person includes all catering services, setup, and staff for the event. We can certainly accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Regarding the bar, we can offer a basic package that includes wine and soft drinks for an additional $15 per person, or a full bar setup for $30 per person. Let me know which option you prefer, and I can adjust the final price accordingly.  

I look forward to finalizing the details with you!  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu and dietary options. I would like to confirm the basic bar package for our 120 guests, bringing the total to $75 per person. This brings the final cost to $9,000, which I believe is fair considering the quality you provide.  

I understand the cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event, which works for us. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything.  

Looking forward to working with you!  

Best regards,  
Rachel
