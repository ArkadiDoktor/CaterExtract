Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand that you're organizing a corporate seminar for next month and are looking for catering options. At Culinary Delights, we specialize in providing high-quality, kosher catering services.  

For your event, we can offer a delicious mixed menu featuring items such as herb-roasted chicken, seasonal vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet salads. Our services typically start at $30 per person, and we can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. This pricing includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian and gluten-free options. If you would like to include a bar service, we can discuss that as well.  

Please let me know the date of your event so I can prepare a detailed proposal with all the necessary information.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The seminar is scheduled for April 15th, and we expect around 100 attendees. I appreciate the menu options you provided. However, I was hoping to keep the budget around $25 per person. Is there any flexibility in your pricing or menu items to help meet this target?  

Also, could you clarify if the bar service you mentioned is included in the initial quote?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,  
Jessica

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your response and for providing the event date. I can adjust the menu to meet your budget of $25 per person by offering a more streamlined selection, such as BBQ chicken, roasted vegetables, and a simpler salad option. If we proceed with this updated menu, the total would come to $2,500 for 100 guests.  

Regarding the bar service, it is not included in the initial pricing but can be added for an extra $15 per person. Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,  
Mark
