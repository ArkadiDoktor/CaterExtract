Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for the wedding on June 15th, 2024. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. We typically offer a range of menu options, including a mixed menu with both meat and dairy dishes, and we can accommodate various dietary needs including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a complete buffet setup with staff. For a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150, this would bring the total to a range of $3,750 to $11,250, depending on your final guest count. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

Additionally, our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a selection of beverages, but a full bar would be an additional cost.  

I look forward to your feedback, and we can discuss the specific menu items that you have in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. I appreciate the inclusion of the kosher certification and dietary options. However, I would like to clarify a couple of details before we proceed.  

Are you able to provide a fixed price for 75 guests? Additionally, could you let me know if the beverages included are soft drinks and water, or if there are any additional options available? Lastly, could you provide a little more detail on the setup and staffing during the event?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear from you. For 75 guests, the fixed price would be $5,625, which includes all the services previously mentioned. The beverages we provide consist of soft drinks and water, and for a full bar, we can arrange that at an additional cost.  

As for setup and staffing, we will arrive two hours before the event starts to ensure everything is ready, and we will have a team of three staff members to assist with the buffet and any guest needs throughout the evening.  

Please let me know if this meets your expectations, and if so, we can move forward with the agreement.  

Best regards,
