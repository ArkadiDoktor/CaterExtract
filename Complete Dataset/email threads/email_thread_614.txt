Dear Julia,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering services for the corporate gala you are organizing on December 15th at the Grand Hotel. We specialize in providing high-quality food and can offer a range of menu options that cater to various tastes and dietary needs.  

For this event, we can provide a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy dishes, all under strict kosher supervision by the Vaad HaKashrut. Our pricing structure is set at twenty-five dollars per person, and this includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of fifty guests and a maximum of two hundred.  

Additionally, our package can include a selection of beverages, or we can provide a bar service at an additional cost. We are also able to offer dietary accommodations for vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this in further detail or if you have specific requirements in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed an important event for us, and your offerings sound promising. I appreciate the kosher certification, which is essential for our attendees.  

I would like to confirm if the price of twenty-five dollars per person includes all the proposed menu items. Could you also provide a sample menu or highlights of the dishes you typically serve? Lastly, considering our expected guest count might fluctuate, what are your cancellation terms if we need to make adjustments close to the event date?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Julia,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The price of twenty-five dollars per person does cover our standard menu items, which include options like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and an assortment of gourmet salads. I will attach a detailed menu for your review.  

Regarding your question about cancellation, we have a flexible policy that allows for changes up to one week before the event, with a full refund of deposits if canceled within that timeframe.  

If you are ready to proceed, I can reserve your date for the expected range of guests. Please let me know how you would like to move forward.
