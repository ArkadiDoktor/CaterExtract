Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your corporate event scheduled for October 15th. We would be delighted to assist you.  

We offer a variety of menu options that can be tailored to your needs. Our pricing structure is based on a per person rate, typically ranging from $30 to $50, depending on the selected dishes. Our minimum guest count is 50, and we can accommodate up to 150 guests.  

All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision from the OK Kosher Certification, ensuring they meet the highest standards. We can provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, along with vegetarian dishes to cater to various dietary requirements.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. I appreciate the kosher supervision and the mixed menu options. However, could you clarify whether the per person price includes VAT? Also, we are considering a bar service for the event. Would that be included in your proposal, or is it offered separately?  

Looking forward to your response.

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The per person pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total amount. As for the bar service, we can certainly offer that as an add-on. The cost for a standard bar service would be an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

If you decide on 100 guests, the total would be $4,500 plus VAT for the catering, and an additional $1,500 for the bar service, bringing the total to $6,000 before taxes. Please let me know your thoughts, and we can finalize the details.
