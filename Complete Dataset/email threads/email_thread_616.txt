Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming conference on December 5th. We would love to provide catering services for this important event. We specialize in a variety of menu options, including kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union, which is a popular choice for many of our clients.

For a gathering of 50 to 150 guests, we typically charge a fixed price of $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and dessert. Beverages can be arranged separately if you would like to include them. All prices include VAT, providing clarity on the final cost. 

We can accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. I would be happy to discuss menu highlights and any specific requests you might have.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Dear David,

Thank you for your quick response. The offer sounds promising, but I’d like to clarify a few things. We expect around 75 guests, and while I appreciate the fixed price, is there any flexibility for a lower price if we go with a simpler menu? Additionally, could you provide more details about the menu, particularly the main course options? 

I am also curious if the bar services can be included in your proposal. 

Thank you for your assistance.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your follow-up questions. For a simpler menu, we can offer a price of $40 per person for a minimum of 75 guests. This would still include a selection of appetizers and one main course, along with dessert. 

Regarding the bar, we can add a beverage package for an additional $15 per person, which includes soft drinks and a selection of wines. We can certainly work with you to ensure the menu aligns with your expectations while keeping everything within budget.

Please let me know if this proposal works for you.

Warm regards,

Please confirm the final details regarding the menu and setup, and let me know your cancellation policy. 

Looking forward to working together.
