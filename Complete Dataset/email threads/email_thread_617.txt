Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our catering options include a variety of dishes, and we specialize in kosher cuisine supervised by the Orthodox Union. 

For your event, we typically recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. This price includes VAT and covers the meals, setup, and staffing for the evening.

Please let me know if you have any particular dishes in mind or if there are specific dietary restrictions we should consider. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The mixed menu sounds great, and I’m glad to hear about the kosher supervision. However, I am wondering if there’s any flexibility on the pricing. Our budget is a bit tight, and I was hoping to stay closer to $40 per person.  

Also, could you please confirm if beverages are included in that price? We might need to consider a separate bar service if they are not.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your budget concerns. While our standard rate is $45 per person, I can offer a reduced menu option bringing the price down to $40 per person. This would include a selection of our most popular dishes, such as roasted chicken and vegetable lasagna, while still keeping the kosher supervision intact.  

Regarding beverages, the initial quote does not include a bar service. We can certainly discuss options for a beverage package if that would be of interest. Let me know if this adjusted offer works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for accommodating my request. I would like to accept the revised offer of $40 per person for the catering on March 15th. Please ensure that the menu includes the roasted chicken and vegetable lasagna, as mentioned. I would also like to discuss the beverage options separately, as I believe a bar service would enhance the evening.  

Could you also provide me with your cancellation policy? I appreciate your assistance and look forward to working together.  

Best regards,
