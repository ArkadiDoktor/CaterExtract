Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on December 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special occasion.  

We specialize in a variety of menus and can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which typically ranges from $35 to $50, depending on the selected menu items. All prices include VAT.  

We offer a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled salmon, roasted vegetable risotto, and a selection of gourmet salads. Additionally, we can ensure that the food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Unfortunately, we do not provide a bar service, but we can recommend some local vendors if needed.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences. I look forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I am particularly interested in the mixed menu and appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I would like to clarify a few details.  

Could we possibly negotiate the price to be closer to $40 per person for a confirmed guest count of 120? Also, could you confirm if you can accommodate any gluten-free options for some of our guests?  

Lastly, could you provide insight into your cancellation policy? It’s important for us to have that information as we finalize planning.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I understand your budget concerns, and I can confirm the price of $40 per person for 120 guests, which would bring the total to $4,800. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free options as well.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days before the event for a full refund. After that, a 50% cancellation fee applies.  

Let me know if this works for you so we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best,  
James
