Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your catering needs for the charity gala scheduled for June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services for events like yours.  

Our menu options can accommodate a range of dietary preferences, including kosher meals under strict rabbinical supervision. We can offer a mixed menu featuring meat and vegetarian options, and we are flexible with guest counts, serving between 50 to 150 attendees.  

We typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing, with VAT already included in the total amount. If you would like, I can send over a sample menu and discuss any specific requirements you might have, such as beverage options or dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a couple of points. We might have between 80 to 120 guests, so I want to ensure the pricing remains at $75 per person for that range. Additionally, could you confirm whether the bar service is included in that price?  

I appreciate your attention to dietary restrictions, particularly for our kosher guests. Could you share details about the supervision?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, we can confirm that the price of $75 per person applies for your expected guest range of 80 to 120 attendees. However, the bar service is not included in that price, and we typically offer a variety of beverages at an additional cost.  

As for the kosher meals, they are supervised by Rabbi Samuels from the local synagogue, ensuring all requirements are met. Please let me know if you would like to see the bar options and any specific menu items, and I can prepare a detailed proposal.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the updates. I would like to proceed with your catering service for our charity gala on June 15th. We will definitely need kosher meals supervised by Rabbi Samuels and would like to finalize our guest count closer to the date. For the bar, please provide the options available and their pricing.  

Considering everything, I understand the total will be $6,000 for 80 guests, with VAT included. I appreciate your flexibility. Please send over the contract, including the cancellation policy, so we can move forward.
