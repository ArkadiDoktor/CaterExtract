Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your wedding on May 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special occasion. Our catering service specializes in a range of cuisines, and we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Our pricing structure is based on a per person rate of $75, which includes a three-course meal and staff for setup and service. Please note that this price does not include beverages, but we can arrange a bar service if needed.  

We ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Rabbinical Council of America. The final price will include VAT, which is calculated at 8%.  

Please let me know if you have any dietary requirements or specific menu items in mind, and I would be happy to provide further details.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The per person rate sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to explore options that might fit our budget a bit better. Is there any flexibility on the pricing if we decide to go with a fixed price for the entire event? Also, could you clarify what the three-course meal typically includes?  

We have about 80 guests confirmed so far, and I want to ensure we accommodate all dietary needs, including vegetarian options.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. We can offer a fixed price for the event if that would be more suitable for you. For 80 guests, we could provide a flat rate of $5,600, which includes the three-course meal, staff services, and VAT. The meal typically consists of a choice of appetizers, a main course with meat or vegetarian options, and a dessert selection.  

In terms of dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian dishes and are open to discussing any other specific needs you might have. Please let me know if this pricing aligns with your expectations, and we can move forward from there.  

Best,  
David

Hi David,  

Thank you for your revised proposal. The flat rate of $5,600 for 80 guests works perfectly for us, and I appreciate your willingness to accommodate dietary options. We would like to proceed with the agreement, ensuring the menu includes a variety of appetizers and both meat and vegetarian main courses.  

Please send over the contract and any additional details regarding setup and cancellation terms. I'm looking forward to finalizing this and making our wedding a memorable event!  

Best regards,
