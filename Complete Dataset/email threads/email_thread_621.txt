Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Michael Cohen, and I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand that you are organizing a corporate gala on March 15th, and I would love to provide our catering services for this special occasion.  

We specialize in a diverse range of menus, including kosher options under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council of New York. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the chosen menu, and we can accommodate between 100 to 250 guests. Please note that our prices include VAT.  

If you are interested, I can send over some sample menus that feature a mix of meat and dairy dishes, along with vegetarian options. Additionally, we can arrange for a fully stocked bar, though that would be an extra charge.  

I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
Michael Cohen

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the catering options. The pricing range sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify a couple of details before moving forward.  

Could you provide a more specific menu suggestion that includes some highlights? We want to ensure that there are plenty of dietary accommodations available, especially for our guests with allergies. Also, I was curious if the final price would include drinks or if that is indeed an additional charge.  

Once I have this information, I can make a decision quickly.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for getting back to me. I appreciate your interest in our catering services. For the event, I recommend our signature beef brisket, roasted vegetable medley, and a delightful chocolate mousse for dessert. We can certainly accommodate dietary needs, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Regarding beverages, the bar setup would be an additional cost, typically around $15 per person. If you prefer, we can include a selection of non-alcoholic drinks in the package at no extra charge.  

Once you finalize the guest count, I can provide you with a precise total. For 150 guests, for instance, the final price would be around $7,500, including VAT. We also have a cancellation policy that allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.  

Please let me know if this meets your expectations.  

Best,
