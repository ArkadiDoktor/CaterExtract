Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala on November 15th. We’re excited about the opportunity to provide our services. Our catering options include a variety of dishes, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, we typically charge $45 per person, and this pricing includes VAT. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian meals. Our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring compliance with all dietary laws.  

Additionally, we offer a selection of beverages for an additional cost if you would like a bar package. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific preferences for the menu.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Ethan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound great, and I appreciate the details regarding dietary accommodations. However, I was hoping to get the price down a bit if we decide to go forward with 75 guests instead of the maximum of 100. Would you be able to offer a discount per person for that number? Additionally, could you clarify whether the bar options are separate from the food price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Jessica

Hi Jessica,  

I completely understand your concern about pricing. For 75 guests, I can offer a reduced price of $40 per person, which would bring the total to $3,000. As for the bar, it is indeed a separate charge, typically around $15 per person, depending on the selection you choose.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any other adjustments you would like to discuss.  

Best,  
Ethan

Hi Ethan,  

Thank you for the revised pricing. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the catering for 75 guests at the agreed price of $3,000, with the understanding of the bar charges being additional. Please confirm our agreement and any next steps regarding the setup and a deposit.  

Best regards,
