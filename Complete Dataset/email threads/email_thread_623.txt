Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th at the Grand Hall. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. Our catering services offer a variety of options to suit your needs, including a mixed menu that features both meat and dairy dishes, crafted to delight all your guests.  

For events of this nature, we generally charge a fixed price of $75 per person. This price includes our standard menu, which consists of dishes such as grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, vegetarian pasta, and a selection of desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and I want to highlight that our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss dietary accommodations or any specific requests you may have. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds wonderful, but I wanted to clarify whether the $75 per person includes VAT, or if that would be added on top. Additionally, we are considering having a bar service for the event. Is that included in your price, or would it be an additional cost?  

I appreciate your assistance as we finalize the details.

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your inquiries. The $75 per person pricing does not include VAT; it will be added to the final invoice. Regarding the bar service, we can certainly provide a selection of beverages, which would be an additional cost depending on the drinks chosen.  

If you have a specific budget for the bar, I can work on a tailored package to fit your needs. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I can adjust the proposal accordingly.  

Warm regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the catering arrangement at the fixed price of $75 per person, plus VAT. We will also opt for the bar service, and I believe we can finalize the drink selections next week. Please reserve the date for our event and let me know if there are any further steps we need to complete.  

Looking forward to working together!
