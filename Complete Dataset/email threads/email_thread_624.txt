Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering services we can provide for your upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We specialize in a diverse menu that can cater to various dietary needs and preferences. Our typical pricing starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts.  

We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests and would be happy to provide a kosher option, supervised by the OU. Additionally, our package can include a variety of beverages, though we can also discuss excluding the bar if that better suits your budget.  

Please let me know if you would like to set up a time to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala sounds exciting, and I appreciate your detailed menu options. I would like to confirm that the price of $50 per person includes VAT, correct? Additionally, while I am interested in the kosher menu, could you provide more details on the main courses available?  

Lastly, could we discuss the possibility of reducing the price a bit? Our budget is a bit tight, and I would love to see if we could arrive at a more favorable rate for a fixed price for the whole event.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your message. Yes, the $50 per person price does include VAT. I can offer a fixed price of $7,000 for up to 150 guests, which would make it a little more manageable for your budget.  

Regarding the kosher menu, we can offer options like herb-roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. I can send over a more detailed menu if you'd like.  

Please let me know if this revised price works for you, and we can finalize the arrangements.
