Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the details you've shared. We are expecting around 150 attendees, so your capacity fits perfectly. However, I wanted to clarify a few points. Are the meals fully kosher? If so, which supervision do you have in place?  

Additionally, while the fixed price per person sounds reasonable, could you provide a breakdown of the menu options? We are looking for a variety of dishes, especially with some vegetarian alternatives. I would also like to discuss beverage options if we decide to include a bar.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Yes, all our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Rabbinical Council of America. For the menu, we can offer options like herb-crusted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of vegetarian pasta dishes. We can also accommodate gluten-free requests if needed.  

Regarding the bar, we can offer a full bar package for an additional 15 per person. So, for 150 guests, the total would come to 9,000, including VAT. If you prefer a simpler beverage option, we can provide soda and juices at a lower rate.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I will finalize the details accordingly.  

Best,  
David
