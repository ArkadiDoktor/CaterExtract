Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We are excited about the possibility of catering your event. We specialize in providing a diverse menu with options that can be tailored to meet dietary needs, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, if that is a requirement for your attendees.  

For a gathering of between 50 to 150 guests, we typically price our services at $50 per person. This includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and desserts. Please note that this pricing does not include beverages, which can be arranged separately. All prices are exclusive of VAT.  

I would love to discuss your specific preferences further and provide a sample menu based on your vision for the evening.  

Best regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I'm wondering if we could adjust the per person rate if we ended up with a larger number of guests, say 200. Additionally, we will need to ensure that drinks are available, so could you provide options for a bar service?  

I appreciate the kosher offering; we will indeed need the meals to meet that requirement. Can you also confirm if the pricing includes VAT? I look forward to your revised proposal.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. We can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person if your guest count reaches 200. As for the bar service, we can include a basic package with soft drinks and a selection of wines for an additional $15 per person. I can confirm that VAT is not included in the initial pricing I provided.  

If you're happy with this proposal, we can discuss the menu options next. Our offerings typically include meat and dairy dishes, but we can certainly accommodate any specific dietary requests. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for the revised proposal. I appreciate the adjustments and am happy to move forward with the $45 per person rate for 200 guests, including the bar package. It would be great to have a mixed menu that includes kosher options under the Orthodox Union supervision. I also request that we get a detailed list of menu highlights soon.  

Regarding cancellation, could you please confirm your policy? I look forward to finalizing the details soon.  

Best wishes,
