Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your catering needs for the upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would love to discuss how we can best serve your guests.

Our pricing structure is generally set at £45 per person, which includes a selection of dishes tailored to your preferences. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150, ensuring that each guest enjoys a delightful meal. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din, and we offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.

In addition, we can provide beverages, including a selection of wines and soft drinks, for an additional cost. I can send you a detailed menu proposal and discuss any specific dietary needs your guests may have.

Please let me know a suitable time for us to discuss this further. Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable for our guest count, but I wanted to clarify if the £45 per person includes VAT. Additionally, could you provide more details on the dietary options available? We may have some guests with specific requirements.

Also, if we decide to include beverages, what would the additional costs look like? I appreciate your help in ensuring this event is a success.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your questions. The £45 per person does not include VAT, which would be added to the final invoice. Regarding dietary accommodations, we can cater to vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options upon request.

As for the beverage service, I can provide a range of packages starting from £15 per person, which includes wine, beer, and soft drinks. If you have a specific beverage in mind, let me know, and I can tailor the package accordingly.

Please feel free to reach out with any more questions or if you’d like to proceed with the booking.
