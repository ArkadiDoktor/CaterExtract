Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you’ve provided about the menu and the pricing structure. Since we’re expecting around 150 guests, I would like to confirm that the total would be $9,000, right?  

Also, could you give me more information about the specific dishes you plan to include? I would like to ensure we have a good variety for our attendees. Lastly, is there any flexibility in the pricing if we decide to increase the guest count?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

You're correct; with 150 guests, the total would indeed be $9,000. Regarding the menu, we typically include options like grilled chicken skewers, a selection of seasonal salads, and a variety of gourmet desserts. We strive to provide a well-rounded experience, and I can certainly send over a complete menu for your review.  

If you anticipate an increase in guests, we can adjust the pricing to $55 per person for any additional attendees, which would help accommodate larger numbers without exceeding your budget.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have further questions.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your clarification and the menu highlights. I would like to proceed with your proposal for 150 guests at $9,000. Please prepare the kosher meals as discussed, and I would appreciate receiving the complete menu for final approval soon.  

As for cancellation terms, could you confirm what those are? I assume we can make changes to the guest count up to a week before the event?  

Thank you for your assistance.
