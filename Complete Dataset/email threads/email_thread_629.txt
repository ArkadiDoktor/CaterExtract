Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our menu offers a range of options, including meat and dairy dishes, and we can accommodate various dietary restrictions.  

Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, and this includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Additionally, we ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a selection of beverages as well, though the bar will be an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you're interested, and I can send over a detailed menu and further information.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable for the services offered. However, could you clarify if the bar prices are fixed or based on consumption? Also, could we adjust the guest minimum to 40 guests, given our current RSVPs?  

Looking forward to your reply so we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your response. The bar pricing is typically based on consumption, allowing flexibility depending on your guests' preferences. Regarding the minimum guest count, we can accommodate 40 guests, but I would need to adjust the price to $50 per person for that smaller group. The final price, including VAT, would then be $2,000 for 40 guests.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the preparations.  

Best,

Please proceed with the arrangements for 40 guests, ensuring the menu includes a variety of meat and dairy options. We will also need the drinks package. I appreciate your help and look forward to working together for a successful event.
