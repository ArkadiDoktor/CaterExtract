Dear Rachel,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for events like yours. I would be happy to discuss our offerings and help you create a memorable experience for your guests.

For events of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu, which can include a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing starts at $45 per person for a minimum of 50 guests, and we can accommodate up to 150 guests. This price includes VAT. We can also tailor the menu to meet specific dietary requirements, including gluten-free and vegan options.

If you’re interested, we can arrange a tasting session to help finalize your menu selection. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you would like to discuss this further.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. Before we proceed, could you clarify if the meals are kosher? Additionally, we are considering a bar for the event. Is that something you can provide, or would we need to arrange that separately?

Finally, would it be possible to negotiate the price a bit lower, perhaps to around $40 per person? It would help us stay within our budget while still providing a great experience for our guests.

Thank you,  
Rachel

Hi Rachel,

I appreciate your questions and interest in our services. Yes, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary laws are adhered to. As for the bar, we do not offer that service directly, but I can recommend a few partners who specialize in event bar services.

Regarding the pricing, I can adjust our offer to $42 per person while still maintaining the quality of our food and service. This would still cover a variety of dishes to satisfy your guests. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.

Best,  
Daniel

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your flexibility with the pricing and for confirming the kosher supervision. I appreciate the adjustments you've made. I’m happy to accept your offer of $42 per person for 100 guests, which brings us to a total of $4,200. This price includes VAT, correct? 

Additionally, I’d like to confirm that the menu will feature a mix of meat and dairy options, and we will inform you of any specific dietary needs as we get closer to the event. Please also note that we will manage the bar separately.

Let’s proceed with the arrangements. Could you please send over a contract outlining the details, including cancellation terms?

Thank you,  
Rachel
