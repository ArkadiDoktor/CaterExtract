Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event. Our typical offerings include a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, and we can accommodate a range of dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For an event of this nature, we generally recommend a pricing structure of $75 per person, which includes setup, staff, and all necessary equipment. We typically cater for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. Please note that our prices include VAT.  

We can also provide a selection of beverages, though the bar service would be an additional cost. If you're interested in kosher options, we offer supervision through the local rabbinical authority.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss the menu in more detail or if there are any specific dishes you are considering.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit. Since we are expecting around 150 guests, would it be possible to adjust the cost to $70 per person? Also, can you provide more details on the menu items? Our guests have various dietary preferences, so it would help to know what options are available.  

I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our needs, and I'm particularly interested in the kosher supervision aspect as well.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. I can offer the price of $70 per person for your gala, given the guest count of 150. As for the menu, we can include options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a decadent chocolate mousse for dessert. All menu items will be prepared under strict kosher supervision.  

Regarding beverages, we can provide a selection of soft drinks and juices at no extra cost, but if you would like a full bar, that would indeed be an additional charge. If you agree to the terms, we can proceed with a formal agreement. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event.  

Thank you for considering us for your catering needs.
