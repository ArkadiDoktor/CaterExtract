Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on April 15, 2024. We would be delighted to provide our services for this occasion.  

Our catering packages typically cater to a range of guest counts, from a minimum of 50 up to 200 attendees. We offer a fixed price of $45 per person, which includes a selection of main dishes, sides, and desserts. We also accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, ensuring all guests can enjoy the meal.  

Our menu features a delicious variety of dishes, including grilled chicken with herb sauce, vegetarian lasagna, and seasonal roasted vegetables. Additionally, we can provide a beverage service, but this is not included in the base price.  

All our food is kosher, supervised by the local Kashrut authority, and we ensure that all preparation meets strict guidelines. Our pricing does include VAT, so there are no hidden costs.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or if you have specific menu requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu you provided sounds appealing, especially the grilled chicken and vegetarian lasagna. I appreciate that the pricing includes VAT as well.  

However, I wanted to clarify if you can accommodate up to 225 guests, as we might see additional attendees. Also, could you confirm if a bar service can be included, or if it's strictly separate?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Unfortunately, our current maximum capacity for a single event is 200 guests. If you anticipate more than that, we can discuss potential solutions, such as staggered service or an additional setup.  

Regarding the bar service, we can certainly include a basic package that features beer and wine for an additional $15 per person. If you prefer a more extensive selection, we can provide options tailored to your preferences.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I can send over a revised proposal.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. Given the maximum guest count and the additional cost for the bar service, I would like to proceed with your initial offer for 200 guests at $45 per person, which totals $9,000. I appreciate the kosher supervision and dietary accommodations you’ve mentioned.  

Please confirm the setup timing and cancellation terms, as I would like to finalize the agreement.  

Thank you, and I look forward to your confirmation.
