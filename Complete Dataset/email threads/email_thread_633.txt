Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your corporate event on June 15th. We would be delighted to assist in making your event a success. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can cater to a wide range of dietary preferences, including kosher options.  

For events like yours, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring various meat and dairy dishes, such as grilled chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of vegetarian options. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes setup and staffing but excludes beverages. We cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200.  

Please note that all food served is under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets kosher standards. We can discuss specific dietary accommodations to suit your guests' needs.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I was hoping to get the price down to around $40 per person if possible. Also, could you confirm if VAT is included in your pricing?  

Additionally, we anticipate around 150 guests, so I want to ensure that we can accommodate everyone comfortably. Could you clarify what the cancellation policy looks like?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget concerns. I can offer the mixed menu at $42 per person, which will include VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

We can definitely accommodate 150 guests, including dietary restrictions you may have in mind. Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over the finalized details.
