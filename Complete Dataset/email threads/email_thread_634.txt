Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights. We are excited about the opportunity to cater your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for March 15th. Our team specializes in creating memorable culinary experiences, and I believe we can provide a fantastic menu tailored to your needs.  

For your event, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests. Our dishes are certified kosher under the supervision of the Star-K organization, and we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

Please let me know if you would like to include beverages or if you have specific dietary requirements we should consider. I look forward to your response so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, though I was hoping to explore a few options. We might have around 75 guests, and I would appreciate it if you could provide insight into any dietary accommodations you can offer, particularly for gluten-free and vegetarian attendees.  

Additionally, could you confirm whether the $45 per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top of the final bill? I would also like to know if a bar service is possible with the catering package.  

Looking forward to your clarifications.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The pricing of $45 per person indeed does not include VAT, which will be added at the applicable rate. We can accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian options within the menu.  

As for the bar service, we can offer a separate beverage package starting at an additional $15 per person, which would cover a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. If you prefer, we can also discuss a more extensive bar option.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the final details and the contract.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the additional information. I appreciate your flexibility in accommodating dietary needs and the clarification regarding the pricing. I would like to proceed with the $45 per person catering, plus the bar service at $15 per person, which brings the final total to $4,500 for 75 guests, including VAT.  

Please prepare the contract and let me know the cancellation terms. I look forward to working together to make this a successful event!
