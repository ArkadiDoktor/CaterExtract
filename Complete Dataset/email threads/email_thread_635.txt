Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be pleased to provide a delightful dining experience for your guests. Our catering menu typically features a variety of options, including meat and vegetarian dishes, and we can also accommodate specific dietary needs upon request.  

Based on your estimated attendance of 100 to 150 guests, our pricing structure is set at $50 per person, which includes a three-course meal and a selection of non-alcoholic beverages. Please note that VAT is included in this price. We ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a mixed menu that caters to various preferences.  

I would love to discuss this further and see how we can best serve your event.  

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details about your offerings. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wonder if there’s any flexibility, especially with the guest count possibly fluctuating between 100 to 150. Additionally, could you clarify if the $50 per person includes any bar service, as we are considering offering alcoholic beverages as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your inquiry regarding the pricing. We can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person if the guest count reaches the minimum of 120. Unfortunately, our standard package does not include bar service, but we can arrange a separate beverage package for an additional cost of $15 per guest.  

In terms of cancellation, we require notice at least ten days prior to the event for a full refund. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the arrangement or if there’s anything else you need.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarity on pricing and the cancellation policy. I would like to proceed with the arrangement at $45 per person for 120 guests, and we will opt for the additional beverage package as well. This brings the total to $7,200, which I confirm includes VAT. Please prepare the contract, and we can discuss any further details, including the setup and timing as we get closer to the date.
