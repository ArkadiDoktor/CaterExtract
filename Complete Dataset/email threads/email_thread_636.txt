Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information regarding your catering services. I appreciate the details you've provided. However, I am concerned about the price per person, as it may exceed our budget. Is there any possibility of adjusting the menu to bring the cost down?  

Additionally, could you confirm whether the $45 includes VAT? We are also considering adding a bar service, so any details on that would be helpful.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand your concerns about the budget. We can certainly adjust the menu and offer a more simplified selection, which could bring the cost down to $40 per person. This pricing still includes all food preparation and staff service.  

Regarding VAT, the price does not include it, so you would need to add 20% on top of the $40 per person. As for the bar, we can provide a range of beverage packages starting at an additional $15 per person, which includes soft drinks and juices. If you would like to discuss this further, I am here to help.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility and the revised pricing. I appreciate your assistance in accommodating our budget. I would like to proceed with the adjusted menu at $40 per person for 75 guests, which brings the total to $3,000 plus VAT. This includes the staff service and setup as discussed.  

Please confirm that this deal is valid, along with your cancellation policy, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
