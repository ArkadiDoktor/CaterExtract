Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in providing exquisite dining experiences, and I would love to help make your event memorable.  

Our pricing typically ranges from $45 to $75 per person, depending on the menu selections. We can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, and we are also able to accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free. All our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Chicago Rabbinical Council.  

Please let me know how many guests you anticipate. We usually cater to a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 200 guests. Additionally, we can provide a selection of non-alcoholic beverages, but a full bar service would be an extra cost.  

I look forward to your response so we can discuss your specific requirements further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the information regarding your catering services. I appreciate the range you've provided, but I was hoping we could discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would it be possible to secure a fixed price of $50 per person? We expect around 150 guests, so that would keep things manageable.  

Also, could you clarify if the $50 includes VAT or if that will be added on top? Lastly, while I appreciate the kosher offerings, we are particularly looking for a more diverse menu that includes some pareve options.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,
