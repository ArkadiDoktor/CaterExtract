We offer a variety of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed selections, with an emphasis on high-quality, fresh ingredients. Our pricing typically starts at $45 per person with a minimum guest count of 50. We can accommodate up to 200 guests. All our meals can be prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards for dietary needs.  

We also offer a selection of beverages and can provide a full bar service if required, though it is not included in the base pricing. For your event, we can provide a range of dishes, including herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and a variety of gourmet salads.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any specific requests.

Hello Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds wonderful, especially the herb-roasted chicken. Before we proceed, I have a few questions.  

Is the $45 per person rate inclusive of VAT? Additionally, could you clarify the range of dietary accommodations you can offer? We may have guests with various dietary restrictions. Lastly, while I appreciate the bar service option, it would be helpful to know if we can keep the pricing structure flexible or if it’s fixed.  

Looking forward to your insights.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person does not include VAT, so that will be added on top. We can certainly accommodate a variety of dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Regarding the bar service, we can offer a flexible pricing structure based on your preferences. If you decide to include it, we can adjust the final price accordingly. For 100 guests, the total would be approximately $4,500, plus VAT.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any other details you would like to discuss.  

Best wishes,

Thank you for the clarifications. I appreciate the flexibility with the bar service and the detailed menu options. I would like to confirm our order for 100 guests, with a total of $4,500 plus VAT. Please proceed with preparing the contract.  

I would also like to confirm that you will handle setup and staffing for the event. If you could send over the cancellation terms as well, that would be great.  

Looking forward to finalizing everything.
