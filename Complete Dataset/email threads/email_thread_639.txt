Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. We specialize in a range of options, and I believe we can create a wonderful menu that will impress your guests.

For the event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $50 per person, and this includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests for your dinner. Please let me know if you would like to discuss any specific dietary needs or preferences, as we are happy to adjust the menu accordingly.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds promising, but I’d like to clarify a couple of details before moving forward. Can you confirm if the food is kosher? We have some guests who require it, and it would be great to know the supervision involved.

Additionally, could you provide details on what beverages are included? We are considering offering a bar service, but I want to ensure it fits within the budget. If possible, could we negotiate the price per person down to $45?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your questions and interest in our services. The food we provide is indeed kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Regarding beverages, our standard package does not include a bar, but we can add a bar service for an additional fee, which I can detail for you if needed.

As for the pricing, I can accommodate your request and offer the price at $45 per person, given the minimum guest count of 50. This will bring the total to $2,250 for 50 guests, inclusive of VAT. 

Please let me know if this works for you so we can finalize the arrangements.

Warm regards,
