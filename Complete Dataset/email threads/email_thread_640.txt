Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Our team specializes in providing a diverse menu that can cater to various dietary preferences, with options for meat, dairy, and pareve.  

For this event, we can offer a selection of dishes, including herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person fee, which typically ranges from $30 to $50, depending on the specific menu selections and any additional services you may require. Please let us know your estimated guest count so we can provide a more precise quote.  

We take pride in our kosher offerings, supervised under the Orthodox Union, and we ensure that all food is prepared following strict kosher guidelines. In addition, we can provide a full bar service at an additional cost if that is something you would be interested in.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response and the information provided. We expect around 120 guests for the gala, and I appreciate the menu suggestions. I am particularly interested in the herb-crusted salmon.  

Could you clarify if the price includes VAT? Also, I would like to know if you can accommodate gluten-free options, as we have some guests with dietary restrictions. Lastly, could you confirm the cancellation policy?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the per-person fee. For the gluten-free options, we can certainly provide alternatives, including gluten-free pasta and custom salads tailored to your guests' needs.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we do require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund, but I can provide a detailed breakdown of that in our agreement. Based on your guest count, the total price would be approximately $4,200, which includes setup and staffing.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare a formal agreement.
