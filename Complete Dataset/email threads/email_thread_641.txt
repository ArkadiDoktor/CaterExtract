Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event on December 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your winter gala. Our team specializes in a mixed menu, which can include options like roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a variety of vegetarian dishes.  

We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and our pricing is set at 45 dollars per person, including VAT. We also offer dietary accommodations, such as gluten-free and vegan options, to meet your guests' needs. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages, as our packages typically do not cover the bar.  

I look forward to hearing from you soon to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the pricing structure you've provided, but I was hoping to clarify a few things. First, could you confirm if the menu is kosher? If so, what supervision do you have in place?  

Also, while I find the 45 dollars per person reasonable, would you be able to offer a discount if we finalize the agreement soon? Lastly, could you let me know what dishes you would suggest for the vegetarian options?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up questions. I can confirm that our menu is kosher and supervised by the local Orthodox Union. Regarding your request for pricing adjustments, I can offer a rate of 40 dollars per person if we proceed by next week. As for the vegetarian options, I would recommend dishes like stuffed bell peppers and a quinoa salad with seasonal vegetables.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

I appreciate your response and the adjustments you've made. The kosher supervision is exactly what we need, and the revised price of 40 dollars per person makes it more manageable for us. I would like to confirm the catering for 125 guests, which totals 5,000 dollars, including VAT. We will handle the beverages separately.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience, and let me know if you need any further information from my side about the event setup.  

Thank you for your help!  

Best regards,
