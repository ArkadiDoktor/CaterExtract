Dear Hannah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our team specializes in providing high-quality kosher meals, and we are currently under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

We typically offer a mixed menu, including options for meat and dairy, ensuring there is something for everyone. For your event, we can provide a delightful selection of dishes, including roasted herb chicken, grilled seasonal vegetables, and a variety of salads.  

Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price per person, which is set at $75, including VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and we also offer dietary accommodations for gluten-free and vegetarian options.  

Please let me know if you have any specific requests or questions, and I will be happy to assist you further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the inclusion of dietary accommodations. However, we are working within a budget and would like to know if there is any flexibility in the pricing. Would you be able to offer a lower price for the upper range of guests, perhaps around $65 per person? Additionally, can you confirm if beverages are included in this price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Hannah,  

I appreciate your feedback. While I understand the budget considerations, $75 is the minimum we can offer for a full-service package, which includes setup and staffing. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in that price, but we can provide a bar service for an additional $15 per person, which would cover a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

If you still want to proceed, I can assure you that our team will ensure everything runs smoothly on the day of the event. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. While I appreciate the quality of your offerings, I will need to stick to my budget constraints. Therefore, I will have to decline your proposal at this time. I hope we can work together in the future when circumstances allow for a more flexible budget.  

Thank you for your time and understanding.
