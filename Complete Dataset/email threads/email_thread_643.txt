Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for March 15. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services for events like yours and would love to assist.

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that features a variety of dishes including grilled chicken, vegetarian pasta, and seasonal salads. Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $50 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and I can confirm that our offerings are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. We also provide a selection of beverages, but a full bar service would be an additional cost.

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to discuss this proposal further.

Best regards,  
Michael Johnson

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds promising, especially with the kosher supervision. However, I was wondering if there is any flexibility on the pricing if we decide to go with around 150 guests. Additionally, could you clarify if the $50 per person includes VAT, and what the cancellation terms are?

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your questions. The $50 per person rate does include VAT, which should simplify your budgeting. Given your interest in around 150 guests, I can offer a slight discount, bringing the price down to $45 per person for that number. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event date.

If you have any further questions or need adjustments to the menu, please let me know.

Best regards,
