Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala on March 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing is structured at a rate of $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and our team is available to assist with setup and service during the event.  

We are certified kosher under the supervision of the OK Kosher Certification, and we can provide a selection of kosher wines if you're interested in a beverage service. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements to consider.

Hi Tom,  

Thank you for your detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety in your menu options and the kosher certification. However, I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the price per person, as we are working with a tighter budget. Additionally, does the package include any bar service, or would that be separate?  

I’d also like to confirm that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event date.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I understand the need to manage costs, and I can offer a revised rate of $70 per person if you confirm the minimum of 100 guests. The bar service would be an additional $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we do offer a full refund if canceled two weeks prior, allowing you some peace of mind as you finalize your plans. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.
