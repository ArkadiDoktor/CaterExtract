Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand that you are organizing a corporate gala scheduled for April 15, 2024, and I would love to provide you with our catering services.  

We specialize in a mixed menu which can include both meat and dairy options, and all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a complete three-course meal along with setup and staff for the event. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. Please let me know if you’d like to see a sample menu or if you have any specific dietary needs to consider.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details regarding your services. The pricing structure sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit, especially as our budget is quite tight. Would you be open to discussing a fixed price for 100 guests? Additionally, could you clarify if the VAT is included in your quoted price?  

I appreciate your attention to kosher dietary requirements, and we will have a few guests with specific dietary restrictions to accommodate. Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I completely understand your position regarding the budget constraints. For a fixed price, we can offer $4,200 for 100 guests, which does include VAT. This package would cover a mixed menu featuring dishes such as grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

We can also accommodate any specific dietary needs, such as gluten-free or vegan options, upon request. Please note that beverages are not included in this price, but we can arrange a separate beverage package if needed.  

Let me know if this works for you or if you need any further adjustments.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen
