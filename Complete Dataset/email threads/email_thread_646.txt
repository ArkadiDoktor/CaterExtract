Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding on June 15th. I’m excited to discuss how we can cater your special day. Based on our previous conversations, we can offer a diverse menu that includes a selection of meat and dairy dishes, ensuring there's something for everyone.  

Our pricing is set at 50 dollars per person, which includes VAT. We typically cater for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority, ensuring that all dietary needs are met.  

In addition to the food, we can arrange for a full bar service or offer a selection of beverages, depending on your preferences. Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu, and I’ll be happy to send that over.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The menu sounds great, and I would like to see a sample menu to get a better idea of the options available.  

However, I have some concerns regarding the per-person pricing. We are expecting around 120 guests, but our budget is a bit tight. Would you be open to discussing a fixed price for the entire event? Also, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the per-person cost?  

Thanks for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to work within your budget. For a fixed price, I can offer a package deal of $5,500 for 120 guests, which would include a variety of dishes, the bar service, and all necessary staffing. This package would cover everything, including setup and cleanup.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a detailed menu for your review. I want to make sure your wedding is a memorable event.
