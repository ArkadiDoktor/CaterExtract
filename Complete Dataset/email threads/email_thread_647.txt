Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th at the Grand Pavilion. We would be delighted to assist you in making this special day memorable.  

We offer a diverse menu with options suitable for various dietary needs, including kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our typical pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which varies depending on the selected dishes. For a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, our pricing can range from $60 to $80 per person. This includes VAT.  

Please let us know the estimated number of guests, as we can accommodate between 50 and 150 attendees. Additionally, we can provide beverages as an add-on if desired.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thanks for your prompt response and for the information provided. We are currently expecting around 100 guests, and I appreciate the range you’ve given for the pricing. I wanted to confirm if you could provide a sample menu or some representative dishes, as we are particularly interested in ensuring there are plenty of vegetarian options.  

Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation terms? It’s essential for us to understand how that would work should any unexpected changes arise.  

Thanks again, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear from you again. For a guest count of 100, we can tailor a menu that includes a variety of vegetarian and meat options. Popular items include stuffed peppers, roasted vegetable platters, and a delectable beef brisket.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made. If you decide to go ahead with the catering, the final price would be $70 per person, which would total $7,000 for 100 guests. This includes VAT, but beverages would be an additional charge.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any further adjustments you’d like to discuss.  

Best,
