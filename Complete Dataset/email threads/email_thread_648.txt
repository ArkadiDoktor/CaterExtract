Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on May 14th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals and excellent service to make your event memorable.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which is currently set at $75 per guest. This includes a variety of dishes, such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of artisanal breads. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. Please note that our pricing includes VAT.  

Moreover, we can provide kosher catering under the supervision of the local Orthodox Rabbi, ensuring all dietary laws are respected. We can also discuss beverage options separately if you would like to include a bar service.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed, or if you have specific menu items in mind that we can include.   

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the information on the kosher supervision and the menu options. The range of $75 per person seems reasonable, but our budget is a bit tight. Is there any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we confirm a guest count on the lower end?  

Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in that pricing, or would they be an additional cost? We are expecting around 80 guests, but I would like to confirm the final count as soon as we finalize the menu.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to stay within budget. We can offer a slightly lower rate of $70 per person if you confirm at least 80 guests. This would provide you with a wonderful selection of dishes while accommodating your financial constraints.  

Regarding beverages, they are not included in the per-person price, but we can customize a beverage package for you. I suggest we can provide a modest selection of wines and soft drinks for about $15 per person. This way, you can have the option to offer drinks without exceeding your budget.  

Please let me know if this proposal works for you, and we can move forward with the details.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your offer of $70 per person for the catering, and I’m happy to confirm 80 guests. The additional beverage package sounds great, so let’s go ahead with that. The total price will come to $6,800, which includes VAT.  

I’d like to request a final menu selection and details on the setup and staffing so we can finalize everything. Your attention to these details is very reassuring. Please note that our cancellation policy will need to be discussed in case any changes arise as we get closer to the date.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
