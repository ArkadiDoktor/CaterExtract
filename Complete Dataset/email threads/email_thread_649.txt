Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for January 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event.  

We specialize in a mixed menu that includes options for meat and dairy, and we can accommodate a range of dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. The pricing structure we typically use is a fixed price of $45 per person, which includes all food and setup. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

Our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, and we can provide more details about that if needed. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages, as we can offer a bar service at an additional cost.  

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the dietary accommodations you can provide. However, I would like to confirm whether the $45 per person price includes VAT or if that will be added on top.  

Additionally, could you provide a few examples of the menu items you typically offer? I want to ensure we align with our guests' preferences. Also, since we may have around 80 guests, could you confirm the final price for that number?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. For your group of 80 guests, the total would be $3,600. As for the menu, we can offer highlights such as grilled salmon, stuffed chicken breast, and a variety of gourmet salads.  

Please let me know if there are any specific dishes you would like to include or if you have further questions. We want to ensure everything is perfect for your event.
