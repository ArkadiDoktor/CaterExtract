Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Corporate Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for the corporate event scheduled for November 15th at the Riverfront Conference Center. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can tailor our offerings to suit your needs.  

For this event, we recommend a mixed menu that includes options such as grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific dietary requirements we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your proposal. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the clarity on pricing. However, we are looking for options that include kosher supervision, as several of our attendees adhere to dietary restrictions. Would it be possible to adjust the menu accordingly? If so, could you provide more details regarding kosher supervision and any potential changes in pricing?  

Also, do you include beverages in the package, or would that be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I can certainly accommodate your request for a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We can include options like beef brisket, roasted vegetables, and pareve desserts. The adjusted price for the kosher menu would be $50 per person, which still includes VAT.  

Regarding beverages, we can include a selection of soft drinks and juices in the package, while alcoholic beverages would be an additional cost.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can reserve the date.  

Best wishes,
