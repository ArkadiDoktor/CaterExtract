Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food for events like yours and would love to assist you in creating a memorable experience for you and your guests.  

Our catering services offer a variety of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Rabbinical Council. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, ensuring all your guests are well taken care of.  

For your event, we typically price our services at a fixed rate of $75 per person. This includes setup and staffing, but please note that beverages are not included in that price. We can discuss a bar package separately if you are interested.  

If you expect between 100 and 150 guests, we would be delighted to provide you with a representative menu once we finalize the number. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund of any deposits made up to 30 days before the event.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions.  

Best regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The pricing of $75 per person seems reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss the total cost a bit more, especially if we end up with 150 guests. Would you be able to give me a breakdown of how the final price would look in that case? Also, could you clarify if VAT is included in that price?  

I appreciate that your menu is kosher; could you provide some examples of what the representative menu items might be? Lastly, I am also interested in knowing if you can offer any additional beverage options that we can consider.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. If you have 150 guests, the total cost would amount to $11,250. This price includes VAT, so there are no additional charges on top of that.  

For the menu, we can offer dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, brisket with root vegetables, a selection of seasonal salads, and gourmet desserts. We can certainly provide a full beverage package with wine, beer, and soft drinks at an additional cost of around $15 per person.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations, and we can move forward with the final arrangements.  

Best,  
Jessica
