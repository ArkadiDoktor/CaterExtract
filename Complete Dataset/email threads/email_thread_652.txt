Dear Samantha,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. At Gourmet Delights, we specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to your event's needs. 

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and are happy to provide dietary options, including vegetarian and gluten-free meals.

Additionally, we can provide a fully stocked bar for an extra fee, or you can choose to supply your own beverages. Please let me know if you would like to see a detailed menu and any specific requests or questions you might have.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Rachel,

Thank you for your proposal. The $75 per person is within our budget, but I would like to clarify a few things. Can you confirm if the food is kosher? If so, what supervision do you have in place? Additionally, we are expecting around 120 guests, but I would like to keep the option open to adjust that number a bit. 

I would also appreciate more details regarding the main dishes you suggest, particularly any options for meat and dairy restrictions. Lastly, could you outline your cancellation policy? 

Thanks for your assistance.

Best,  
Samantha

Hi Samantha,

Thank you for your quick response. I can confirm that our menu is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary laws are adhered to. For the main courses, we can offer options such as herb-roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a delicious vegetarian lasagna.

Regarding our cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made. If the guest count varies, we can adjust the final price accordingly, as long as it remains within the range of 50 to 150 guests.

Please let me know if you have any more questions or if you're ready to move forward.

Best,  
Rachel
