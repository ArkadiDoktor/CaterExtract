Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your event on November 15th. We are excited to help you create a memorable experience. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs, including kosher options. Our kosher meals are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we would be happy to discuss specific menu items that fit your requirements.  

For your event, we typically recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, but we can also tailor it to your preferences. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which generally ranges between $25 to $40, depending on the selected menu and services.  

If you could provide an estimated guest count, we can prepare a more accurate quote. Please let us know if you would like to include beverages in your package as well.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your quick response. We are planning for around 100 guests, and I’d like to ensure that we get the best value possible. Ideally, I am looking at a budget closer to $30 per person. Could you confirm if this includes VAT? Also, could you clarify whether beverages are included in that pricing?  

I would appreciate it if you could provide a few menu highlights that would fit this budget, especially any kosher options you offer.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your patience as we work through the details. We can indeed accommodate your budget of $30 per person, which includes VAT. However, beverages would be an additional cost; we can offer a range of options from soft drinks to a full bar service.  

For the menu, I suggest a selection that includes our grilled chicken with herbs, a vegetarian lasagna, and a garden salad, all of which are kosher under the Orthodox Union. This would suit your guest count well.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details, including our cancellation policy, which is a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Best regards,
