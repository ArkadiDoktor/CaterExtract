Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing, but I wanted to clarify a couple of things. Is the food kosher, and if so, what supervision do you have in place? Additionally, could you confirm whether the bar and beverage service is included in the price?  

We anticipate approximately 100 guests, but we may need to adjust that number, so understanding your flexibility would be helpful.  

Thanks again, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your questions. Yes, all our food is kosher and is prepared under the supervision of the Chicago Rabbinical Council. However, the bar service, which includes both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options, is an additional $20 per person.  

We can accommodate a guest count between 50 and 150, so you have plenty of flexibility. If you confirm the final guest count a week before the event, we can finalize the details.  

Given the current pricing, if you choose to include the bar, the total would come to $95 per person, including VAT. Just let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the booking.  

Best,
