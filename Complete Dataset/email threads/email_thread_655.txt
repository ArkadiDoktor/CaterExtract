Dear Julia,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided about the menu and kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to inquire if there is any flexibility with the price per person, as we are working within a tighter budget. Also, could you specify what the bar service would entail?  

We are expecting closer to 150 guests and would love to understand the options available for dietary restrictions, particularly for vegetarian and gluten-free attendees.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

I understand your concerns regarding the budget. I can offer you a reduced rate of $70 per person if you confirm the booking before the end of this week. The bar service can include a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks, and we can customize the offerings based on your preferences.  

For dietary restrictions, we can easily accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options within the menu. I hope this helps, and I look forward to finalizing the details with you.
