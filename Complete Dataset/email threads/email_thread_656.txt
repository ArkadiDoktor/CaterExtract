Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights Catering. We would be thrilled to cater your upcoming wedding on May 15th. We specialize in providing a memorable dining experience, and our team can accommodate various dietary needs to ensure all your guests are satisfied.  

For a wedding, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We suggest a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. However, if you envision a more intimate gathering, we can discuss further adjustments.  

All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a full bar service upon request, though it is an additional charge. Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or have any specific requests.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your quick response. The pricing seems reasonable, but we are still finalizing our guest list. We anticipate around 70 guests, but we could go as low as 40 if needed. Can you confirm if the price includes the bar service or if it would be an extra cost? Additionally, could you send over the sample menu? I want to ensure there are options that cater to our vegetarian guests as well.

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. The bar service would indeed be an additional cost, generally around $15 per person if you choose to include it. As for the menu, we can certainly provide vegetarian options alongside our standard offerings to accommodate your guests' needs.  

If you decide on 70 guests, the total would be $5,250, which includes VAT but does not cover the bar service. We also offer a cancellation policy that allows for full refunds up to two weeks before the event. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best regards,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for clarifying the details regarding the bar service and the cancellation policy. I appreciate your transparency. After discussing with my partner, we would like to proceed with the catering for 70 guests at the total of $5,250, excluding the bar service. Please send over the contract, and we can finalize the details.  

Looking forward to working with you!
