Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming wedding on June 15th at the Greenfield Event Center. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would be delighted to assist you.  

Our menu features a variety of delicious options, including meat and dairy dishes, accommodating different dietary needs. We can provide services for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. The pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the selected menu items. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or dietary restrictions, and I can suggest suitable options.  

All our food is kosher and prepared under strict supervision by the local Kashrut authority. We can also provide a selection of beverages as part of the package. Our prices include VAT, ensuring transparency in your budgeting.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the details on your catering services. I appreciate the kosher options and the inclusion of VAT. Since our guest list might fluctuate, could you confirm if the pricing structure is flexible based on final numbers?  

Also, I’m interested in a sample menu that includes some of the more popular dishes. We have a few guests with dietary restrictions, so it would be helpful to know what accommodations you can offer.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I’m glad you reached out. The pricing can indeed be adjusted based on the final number of guests, with the final bill calculated based on the confirmed headcount closer to the event date.  

For the menu, I can suggest items like herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a variety of vegetarian options. We can accommodate gluten-free and vegan diets as well. The final price would be set at $65 per person if we go with a mixed menu, which would provide a nice balance for your guests.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require at least two weeks' notice to avoid any charges. Please let me know if this aligns with your plans.

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing and cancellation policy. I would like to proceed with your offer of $65 per person for the mixed menu, ensuring we can accommodate dietary restrictions. I will confirm the final guest count a week before the event.  

Please prepare a detailed menu for review, including the items we've discussed, and let me know if you need any further information from my side. Looking forward to a successful collaboration for the wedding!
