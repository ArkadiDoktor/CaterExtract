Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand that you are organizing a corporate event on November 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can cater for you.  

We specialize in providing a variety of menu options, including both meat and dairy dishes, with a focus on high-quality ingredients. Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our prices are inclusive of VAT.  

Additionally, we offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary needs are met. We can also provide a bar service for an additional fee. Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu in more detail or if you have specific dietary requirements in mind.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. I would like to move forward with a kosher menu, especially since we have several guests with dietary restrictions. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Our budget is around $45 per person. Can you accommodate that?  

Also, could you confirm whether the bar service is included in that price or if it will be an extra charge? I am looking at approximately 100 guests.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I completely understand your budget considerations. While our standard package is $50 per person, I can offer you a special rate of $47 per person for your event if you confirm by the end of this week. This would include a basic bar service as well.  

Regarding the menu, we can provide a mixed selection that includes vegetarian options as well as meat dishes, all under kosher supervision. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can start preparing a detailed proposal.  

Best,
