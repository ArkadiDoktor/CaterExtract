Dear Sarah,  
Thank you for reaching out to Culinary Creations regarding your upcoming corporate event on May 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would be delighted to assist you. For an event of this nature, we recommend a mixed menu that accommodates various dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, and I can offer a range of $50 to $75 per guest, depending on the final menu selection.  
All our food is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards. We can also accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options as needed. Please let me know your estimated guest count, and we can discuss further details including setup, staffing, and any additional equipment you might require.  
Looking forward to your response.

Hi Michael,  
Thank you for your prompt response. We're expecting between 100 and 150 guests, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, I was hoping for a more definitive price. If we were to go with a set menu that includes options like grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of desserts, could you provide me with a final price? It would also help to know if beverages are included in that cost and whether VAT is part of the pricing structure.  
Best,

Hi Sarah,  
I appreciate your follow-up. For a set menu with grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and desserts, we can offer a fixed price of $65 per person, which includes VAT. Beverages, including a selection of soft drinks and coffee, would be an additional $10 per person. We can comfortably cater for a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 150 guests. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event. Please let me know if this aligns with your budget and preferences.  
Warm regards,

Hi Michael,  
Thank you for clarifying the pricing details. The $65 per person price works for us, and I appreciate the inclusion of VAT. I’d like to proceed with the arrangement for 125 guests, including the beverages you mentioned. Could you please send over a contract detailing the agreement, including the cancellation policy? I'm looking forward to a successful event.  
Best regards,
