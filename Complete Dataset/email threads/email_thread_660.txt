Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food and service for events just like yours. Our menu features a mix of meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can offer a variety of dishes, including roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of vegetarian options. We can also provide a bar service, though this would be an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I would be happy to discuss them with you.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate the kosher certification and the variety of menu options you provide. I would like to know if you have any flexibility in pricing if we go with 120 guests instead of the maximum you mentioned. Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the per-person price or if it’s entirely separate?  

We are also considering a few vegan options for our guests with dietary restrictions.  

Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your reply. We can indeed adjust the per-person pricing for 120 guests. If we go with that number, we can offer a fixed price of $8,800, which still includes VAT. The bar service would be charged separately, and I can provide an estimate for that based on your preferences.  

Regarding the vegan options, we can definitely accommodate those requests. We have dishes such as stuffed bell peppers and a quinoa salad that can work well for your guests.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if you have any further questions.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised pricing and for accommodating the vegan options. I would like to move forward with the catering for 120 guests at the fixed price of $8,800, including VAT. Please send over the contract and any details regarding the setup and staffing requirements. I also need to know the cancellation policy in case our plans change.  

Looking forward to finalizing this.
