Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or if you have any additional requests regarding beverages or setup. I can also provide information about our cancellation policy upon request.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the information about your kosher supervision and the pricing. However, we were expecting a slightly lower price point. Is there any flexibility on the per-person cost? Additionally, could you clarify if beverages are included in that price or if they would be an extra charge?

I look forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Emily,

I understand your concerns regarding pricing. While our standard rate is $75 per person, we can offer a discounted rate of $70 per person if you confirm the minimum of 100 guests. This pricing still includes VAT, but please note that beverages would be an additional cost, typically around $15 per person for a full bar. 

If you require any specific dietary accommodations, we can certainly discuss those options as well. 

Let me know how you would like to proceed.

Warm regards,
