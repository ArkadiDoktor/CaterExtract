Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Emily,  

I hope this email finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate event on November 15th, and we would be thrilled to provide catering services for your attendees.  

We offer a diverse menu that can cater to various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our standard pricing is set at $50 per person, and this includes setup and staffing. Please note that our prices exclude VAT, which will be added to the final invoice. Our minimum guest count is 50, and we can accommodate up to 200 guests.  

Additionally, we ensure all our food is kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Beverages can be included at an additional cost if desired.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have specific preferences for the menu.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the flexibility in your menu and the kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. However, we are considering a tighter budget, and I would like to know if there's any room for negotiation on the per-person price.  

Also, could you confirm if the $50 price includes the bar service, or would that be an additional cost? We are expecting around 150 guests for this event.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need for budget considerations. While our standard price is $50 per person, I can offer you a special rate of $45 per person if you book for 150 guests. This price still excludes VAT.  

Regarding the bar service, it would be an additional cost, but I can provide a range of beverage packages to suit your needs. If you prefer, we can also discuss limiting the bar options to keep costs down.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I can send over a revised proposal including the adjusted pricing.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your updated offer. The adjusted price of $45 per person sounds acceptable, and I appreciate your willingness to work with us on the budget. Regarding the beverages, I think we will keep it simple and just go for a basic package.  

Could we finalize the agreement for 150 guests at the price of $45 per person plus VAT? Additionally, please confirm your cancellation policy just in case.  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can move ahead.
