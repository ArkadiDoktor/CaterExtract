Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Culinary Delights for your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would be delighted to cater for your event.  

For a wedding of this nature, we offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, with several vegetarian dishes available as well. Our pricing is set at £45 per person, which includes a three-course meal, and we recommend a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150. All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din, ensuring that all dietary needs are met.  

Please note that our pricing includes VAT, and if you're interested, we can also provide a selection of beverages for an additional cost. We’re flexible with dietary restrictions, so please let us know if there are any specific accommodations needed.  

I look forward to hearing your thoughts!  

Best regards,

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding the catering options. I’m excited about the possibility of working together. However, I’d like to clarify a couple of points.  

We are expecting around 120 guests, so your proposed price per person fits our budget. Can you confirm if the £45 includes both the meal and the beverages? Additionally, if we decide to proceed, what are your cancellation terms?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. The £45 per person does cover the three-course meal, but beverages are priced separately. We can offer a drinks package starting at £15 per person, which includes wine and soft drinks.  

Regarding cancellation, we require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund. Should you cancel within that timeframe, we would retain a 25% deposit.  

If this works for you, I can prepare a formal agreement and secure your date.  

Best,

Hi James,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu and the cancellation terms. I’d like to proceed with the catering arrangement for our wedding on April 15th, with 120 guests, including the drinks package at £15 per person. That brings the total to £7,200, which I understand includes VAT.  

Please send over the formal agreement at your earliest convenience, and I look forward to working together.  

Best regards,
