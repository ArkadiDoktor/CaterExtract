Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We specialize in a variety of menus and can offer a selection of meat and dairy dishes, all under strict kosher supervision by the OK. Our pricing structure is typically set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. 

We can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests, and I can assure you that we are well-prepared to handle any dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian options. Alongside the meal, we can provide beverages at an additional charge if you wish. 

Please let me know if this aligns with your vision for the event, and I’d be happy to discuss it further.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the per-person cost, especially if we confirm a larger guest count. Also, could you clarify if the beverage service is included in the $45, or if that's an additional cost? 

Lastly, would you be able to provide some specific menu highlights? It would be helpful for us to have an idea of what to expect.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can indeed offer a reduced rate of $40 per person if you confirm your final guest count at 100. The beverage service would be an additional cost of around $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

As for the menu, we can feature dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, quinoa salad, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We also cater to various dietary needs, so please let us know of any specific requirements.  

Please feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or if you would like to move forward with this arrangement.

Please confirm that the total price of $5,500 includes VAT and that your cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we cancel up to one week before the event. I look forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the details.
