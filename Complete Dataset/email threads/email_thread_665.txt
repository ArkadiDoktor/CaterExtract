Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to follow up on your inquiry regarding catering services for your charity gala scheduled for April 15th. We would be delighted to provide our catering services for this event.  

Our offerings include a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. We can accommodate up to 200 guests, and our pricing structure is set at $50 per person, inclusive of VAT. We can also provide a selection of beverages, but please note that a full bar service is not included in this price.  

We can offer a variety of dishes, including roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and an assortment of desserts. Additionally, we can cater to dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to get the price down a bit, as we are working with a limited budget. Would you be open to discussing a fixed price for a minimum of 150 guests?  

Also, could you clarify your cancellation policy? We want to ensure everything is covered in case of any changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand the need to work within a budget. For a fixed price, we can offer $7,000 for 150 guests, which would still include the same menu and dietary accommodations. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than two weeks in advance, but unfortunately, we cannot offer refunds for cancellations made within that period.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
