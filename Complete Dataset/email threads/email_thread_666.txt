Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, but I would like to confirm a few details before moving forward. Is there flexibility in the pricing if we have a smaller guest count, say around 50 participants? Also, could you clarify whether beverages are included in that price?  

Lastly, I would appreciate knowing your cancellation policy in case anything changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. If you opt for 50 guests, we can offer a reduced price of $40 per person. This price still includes VAT but does not include beverages, which can be arranged separately at an additional cost. As for our cancellation policy, we require a 48-hour notice before the event for any changes without incurring fees.  

Please let me know if this works for you, or if you have any other questions.  

Best,
