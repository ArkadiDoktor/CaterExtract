Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Culinary Delights regarding your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We would be thrilled to cater for your gathering, which I understand will host between 50 to 100 guests. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which typically ranges from $30 to $50 depending on the menu selections you choose.  

I can assure you that all our food is kosher, prepared under the supervision of the Star-K. We offer a mixed menu, featuring a variety of meat and dairy dishes, as well as pareve options to accommodate different dietary needs. Additionally, we can provide a bar service at an extra cost if you are interested.  

Please let me know your preferences, and I can draft a more detailed proposal.  

Best regards,  
Emily Thompson

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information about the kosher options and the supervision. For our event, we’d prefer a menu that includes some vegetarian dishes along with the meat options. I’d like to confirm that the quoted price includes VAT, as we are working with a fixed budget.  

Could you provide a more specific menu outline and let me know if you can accommodate 80 guests for a total cost of $40 per person? Also, please clarify the cancellation policy.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that the price of $40 per person does include VAT. This would bring your total to $3,200 for 80 guests. We would be happy to include a selection of vegetarian dishes alongside our meat offerings to ensure everyone is catered for.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 10 days prior to the event for a full refund. If you need to cancel closer to the date, we can discuss options for rescheduling.  

Please let me know if this meets your approval, and I’ll prepare a formal contract along with the menu selections.  

Warm regards,
