Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests required and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

In addition to the food, we can also provide a selection of beverages, including soft drinks and juices, but a full bar would need to be arranged separately. We can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian, gluten-free, and nut-free, ensuring all guests have options.  

I would be happy to discuss this further and provide a sample menu. Looking forward to your response!  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate it down a bit since we're expecting a larger crowd. Would you be willing to adjust the rate to $65 per person if we confirm our guest count at 120? I also wanted to confirm that the bar is not included, as we are considering a separate option.  

Could you share some representative menu items? We want to ensure there is something for everyone. Lastly, what are your cancellation terms?  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding pricing, and I'm happy to accommodate your request. We can adjust the rate to $70 per person for 120 guests, which would bring the total to $8,400. The bar remains separate, but we can recommend a few excellent vendors if you need assistance.  

As for the menu, we typically feature items like beef brisket, roasted chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a variety of salads. We can also include a dessert station with traditional pastries. Regarding cancellation, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the formal agreement.
