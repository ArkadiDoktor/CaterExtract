Dear Alice,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. We offer a variety of menus that can be tailored to your needs, including options that are both kosher and non-kosher.  

For a gala dinner, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, which can include dishes such as roasted chicken, seasonal vegetables, and gourmet desserts. Our pricing is set at a rate of $45 per person, which includes everything from setup to service. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200.  

Please note that our prices are exclusive of VAT, which will be added on top. We can also arrange a bar service, although that would be at an additional cost. If you have any specific dietary accommodations or preferences, feel free to share those with us.  

I look forward to your response so that we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided. Before we move forward, I would like to confirm if the $45 per person rate includes any potential dietary accommodations, particularly for vegetarian guests. Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy? Our guest list is still fluctuating, and I want to ensure we have flexibility up to the event date.  

I’m also particularly interested in any kosher supervision details, as we have a few guests who will require this. If we decide to include the bar service, what would the additional costs look like?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Alice,  

Thank you for your questions. I can certainly confirm that we can accommodate vegetarian options within the $45 per person rate, ensuring all dietary needs are met. As for the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to two weeks prior to the event with a full refund.  

Regarding kosher supervision, our meals are prepared under the guidance of the local Orthodox rabbi, ensuring they meet all requirements. If you choose to include the bar, we can offer a selection of wines and spirits for an additional $15 per person.  

Please let me know if this meets your expectations, and we can proceed from there.
