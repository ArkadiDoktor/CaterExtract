For your event, we recommend a pricing structure of $50 per person, and this includes VAT. We can cater to a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250 guests. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed menu options. I appreciate that you can accommodate various dietary needs. However, I was hoping for a more competitive rate given our budget constraints. Is there any flexibility on the per person charge?  

Also, could you confirm if the meals will be kosher and under what supervision? Our audience will expect kosher options, and it is important for us to clarify that aspect.  

Lastly, I wanted to check if beverages are included in the package. We are considering providing a separate bar service, and it would be helpful to know what you offer.  

Thank you, and I look forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the importance of staying within budget. I can offer you a reduced rate of $45 per person if we finalize the contract this week. Regarding the kosher meals, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, which should meet your requirements.  

As for beverages, our package does not include a bar service, but we can certainly assist in coordinating a bar setup if needed. Additionally, we can provide staff for setup and service during the event.  

Let me know if this revised offer aligns with your expectations.  

Warm regards,
