Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering options for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for such occasions, and I believe we can offer a menu that suits your needs perfectly.  

We can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests and our pricing is structured at £35 per person, which is inclusive of VAT. Our menu features a variety of options, including both meat and vegetarian dishes, and we can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din if required.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard packages, but we can arrange for a drinks service if desired. We also offer dietary accommodations, so please let us know if there are any specific needs to consider.  

I would be happy to send you a sample menu and discuss setup and staffing options at your convenience.  

Best regards,

Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I am curious if there's room for negotiation considering our event may lean towards the higher end of the guest count. We might have up to 100 attendees, but it could also be as low as 75.  

Additionally, can we confirm that the £35 per person covers all aspects of the meal, including setup and staff, or would there be additional charges? I appreciate the mention of kosher options, and I believe we will need them for some guests. We would like to see a sample menu to better understand the offerings.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I completely understand your position regarding the pricing, and I can offer a reduced rate of £32 per person if you confirm a final guest count of 100. This price will include setup, staff, and a selection of our most popular dishes, which I would be glad to outline in the sample menu I send over.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can provide options for gluten-free and vegan meals as well. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I’ll prepare that sample menu right away.  

Best,  
James

As for cancellation, please confirm the terms to ensure we have clarity. Once I receive the menu and the cancellation policy, I will finalize everything on my end.  

Thank you for your assistance.
