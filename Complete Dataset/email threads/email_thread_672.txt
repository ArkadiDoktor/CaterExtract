Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala on October 15. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our menu includes a variety of dishes that can cater to your guests' preferences, including options for meat and dairy. We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests, and our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $65 per person, which includes VAT.  

If you're interested, we can offer a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Our food is kosher and prepared under the supervision of the Jerusalem Rabbinate. We also provide beverage packages, but please let us know if you would like a bar service included as well.  

We can discuss dietary accommodations if you have any specific needs. I look forward to your response so we can finalize the details.
