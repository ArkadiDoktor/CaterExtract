Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this occasion. Based on your request, we can offer a mixed menu that includes options for meat and dairy. 

Our pricing structure is set at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This price is inclusive of VAT. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests, and we ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.

In addition to the meal, we can also provide beverages, including a selection of soft drinks and juices, but please note that a full bar is not included in this package. We can certainly make adjustments to the menu for any dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options.

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you would like a detailed menu proposal.

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. The $50 per person price point is a bit higher than we had anticipated. Would you be open to discussing a package that might fit a tighter budget? 

Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could clarify the cancellation terms and whether there are any additional costs for setup or staffing. 

Looking forward to your response.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I understand your concerns regarding the budget, and I appreciate your openness. We can adjust the pricing to $45 per person if we limit the menu to a more streamlined selection. This still includes our kosher options and accommodates dietary needs.

As for cancellation terms, we have a standard policy that allows cancellations up to two weeks before the event with no fees incurred. Any setup or staffing costs would be included in the per-person rate. 

Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a revised menu.

Best regards,
