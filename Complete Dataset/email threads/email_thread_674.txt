Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this event for you. Our team specializes in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate a variety of dietary needs. 

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing structure is typically set at £45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that this price includes VAT. 

Additionally, we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the London Beth Din, and we can accommodate different dietary restrictions upon request. Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu further or if you have any specific requests.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The mixed menu sounds perfect for our guests, and I appreciate the kosher options available. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit, as our budget is a little tighter than anticipated. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to £40 per person? 

Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are included in the pricing or if they would be a separate charge? We’re also considering a standard setup without any additional equipment. 

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to work within a budget. While we usually operate at £45 per person, I can offer a special rate of £42 per person for your event, given the number of guests you anticipate. As for beverages, they are not included in the initial pricing but can be added for an additional £15 per person. 

Please let me know if this adjusted pricing works for you, and I can begin drafting a more detailed menu for your review.  

Best wishes,
