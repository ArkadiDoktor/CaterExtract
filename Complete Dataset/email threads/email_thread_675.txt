Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel from Gourmet Delights Catering, and I understand you are organizing a corporate event on the 15th of November. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would love to assist you with this occasion.  

We offer a diverse menu that includes both meat and dairy options, and we can accommodate various dietary requirements. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, typically around $45, which includes setup and service staff. We also ensure that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, specifically by the Orthodox Union.  

If you could provide me with the expected number of guests, I can prepare a detailed proposal for you. Kindly let me know if you would like to include beverages in the package as well.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Rosen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for reaching out. We are expecting between 50 and 75 guests for the corporate event. I appreciate that you offer kosher food; however, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes VAT? Also, since we may have some guests with dietary restrictions, could you let me know what accommodations you can provide?  

Lastly, we are considering whether to include a bar service. Can you provide details on that as well?  

Thanks again,  
Sarah Mitchell

Hello Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $45 per person rate does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the final bill. For dietary accommodations, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request.  

Regarding the bar service, we can offer a selection of beverages starting at an additional $15 per person, which includes wine and soft drinks. We would need a final guest count to confirm everything.  

If you confirm the minimum of 50 guests, the total cost would be approximately $2,250, plus VAT, with a maximum of 75 guests. Please note our cancellation policy allows for full refunds if canceled more than 10 days before the event.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you!  

Best,
