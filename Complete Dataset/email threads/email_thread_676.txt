Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services.  

For your expected guest count of 50 to 100 attendees, we offer a range of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing structure is set at 45 dollars per person, and this includes all necessary staffing and equipment for setup. Please note that all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

We can also accommodate various dietary needs, such as vegetarian and gluten-free options, to ensure all your guests are catered for. However, beverages would need to be arranged separately, as they are not included in our standard package.  

If you have any specific menu items in mind or would like to discuss this further, please let me know.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The menu sounds promising, but I was hoping to clarify a couple of points. First, since we might have a fluctuating guest count, could you confirm if the pricing remains the same if we go beyond 100 guests? Additionally, is VAT included in the 45 dollars per person, or will that be added on top?  

I am also interested in a few specific menu items, such as brisket and roasted vegetables, so if you could incorporate those, it would be fantastic. Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. The pricing of 45 dollars per person remains fixed, even if the guest count goes beyond 100. VAT is included in that price, so there won’t be any additional charges in that regard.  

I can certainly include brisket and roasted vegetables in the menu. As for the guest count, we can comfortably accommodate up to 120 guests. Just let us know the final numbers as soon as you can.  

Regarding cancellation, we do require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event date. If you have any other questions or need further adjustments, feel free to reach out.  

Best,

Please let me know if you need any further details from my side. I look forward to working together to make this event a success.
