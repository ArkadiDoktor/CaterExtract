Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the catering services for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for May 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events like yours and would love to be a part of it.  

Our pricing typically ranges from $45 to $65 per person, depending on the menu choices you select. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and can offer a mixed menu that includes several meat and vegetarian options. Additionally, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements, and I will be happy to provide you with a representative menu. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. For our event, we expect around 100 attendees, and we’d like to ensure that we have a good variety of options, especially for those with dietary restrictions.  

Could you clarify if the prices you mentioned include VAT? Also, I am curious about whether beverages are included in that pricing or if we would need to handle them separately. I would prefer to keep the budget close to $50 per person if possible.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. The pricing I provided does not include VAT, so please factor that into your budget. As for beverages, we typically offer a separate bar service. However, I can propose a package that includes non-alcoholic beverages at an additional cost of $10 per person.  

If you are looking to stay closer to $50 per person, I can create a menu that focuses on our best value items while ensuring we meet your dietary needs. Would you like to go ahead with that option?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

That sounds excellent. I would like to proceed with the option you suggested, focusing on the best value items, which should help us stay within the $50 per person budget. So, with the additional $10 for beverages, we are looking at a total of $60 per person, which is acceptable.  

Please prepare a formal quote including VAT and all the details. I want to ensure everything is set, especially considering our cancellation policy. Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to seeing the menu options.  

Best regards,
