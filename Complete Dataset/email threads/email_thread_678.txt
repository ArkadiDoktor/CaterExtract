Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us about catering your upcoming gala event on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you and would love to help make your event memorable.  

We offer a variety of catering options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes, all of which can be tailored to accommodate dietary restrictions. Our pricing generally ranges from $45 to $60 per person, depending on the menu selections. This price includes VAT.  

We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests and would be happy to provide a sample menu for your review. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you would like to discuss beverages, as they are typically not included in our standard packages.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the initial pricing information. We are indeed looking for a mixed menu, and I appreciate the flexibility in accommodating dietary needs. However, I’d like to clarify a few details before moving forward.  

Can you provide more specifics on the dishes included in the $45 to $60 range? Additionally, is the food kosher, and if so, what supervision do you have in place? Lastly, we are considering including a bar for the event; could you outline whether that would be an additional cost?  

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. Our mixed menu typically includes dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and seasonal salads, all customizable per your preferences.  

I can confirm that our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. As for the bar, we can provide a full open bar at an additional cost of $20 per person. This would bring the total to around $60 per person if you choose to include the bar.  

Please note that we require a 50% deposit upon confirmation, and our cancellation policy allows for full refunds if cancelled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
