Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on April 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu tailored to meet the specific needs of our clients, and I believe we can create a wonderful experience for you and your guests.  

For this event, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, as well as vegetarian dishes. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests, ensuring that we have the right setup for your needs.  

Additionally, all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K, and we can discuss beverage options further. I would be happy to provide you with a sample menu featuring some of our popular dishes. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I can tailor the menu accordingly.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit on the per-person cost. Given we might have around 100 guests, would you be able to offer a fixed price for the entire event instead?  

Additionally, could you clarify if beverages, especially soft drinks and coffee, are included in your proposal? I would like to ensure everything is covered for our attendees.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your request for a fixed price. For 100 guests, I can offer you a total package of $4,500. This includes the mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, as well as all necessary setup and staffing.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard packages, but we can certainly add a beverage package that includes soft drinks and coffee for an additional $800. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this option.  

Also, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.
