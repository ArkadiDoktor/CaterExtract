Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. Our standard pricing starts at $65 per person, which includes a full three-course meal featuring a selection of meat dishes, as well as vegetarian options. We can comfortably accommodate between 50 to 150 guests.  

All of our food is kosher, under supervision from the Orthodox Union, and we can arrange for a bar service if you would like to include beverages as part of the package. Our team can also assist with setup and staffing to ensure everything runs smoothly.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or menu preferences, and I would be happy to provide a sample menu.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing is reasonable, but I was hoping we could discuss the per-person cost a bit further. Given our budget constraints, we would prefer to keep it closer to $55 per person. Would you be able to accommodate that while still providing a quality menu?  

Additionally, can you confirm whether the $65 price includes VAT, and if the bar service is included in that price? I appreciate your help with this.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns about the budget. While our base price is $65 per person, I can offer a revised menu that brings the cost down to $60 per person. This would still include three courses and a choice of meat and vegetarian options. The pricing I provided does include VAT, but the bar service would be an additional cost of $15 per person.  

Let me know if this adjustment works for your budget, and I can prepare a detailed menu for your review.  

Best regards,

Could you please send over the detailed menu for our review? I’m excited to move forward with this arrangement for our gala dinner.  

Best,
