Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for March 15th. We would be thrilled to cater this event for you. Our team specializes in providing a diverse menu, and we can offer various options to suit your guests’ dietary preferences.  

For an event of this nature, we generally charge $75 per person, and this price includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests up to a maximum of 150. Our menu features a selection of mixed dishes, and we can ensure that kosher options are available under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please note that beverages are not included in the package, but we can certainly provide a separate bar service if that’s something you would like. We offer vegetarian and gluten-free options as well to cater to varied dietary needs.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed pricing. The gala dinner is indeed a significant occasion for us, and we want to ensure everything is perfect. Could you please confirm if the $75 per person includes appetizers and desserts, or if those are additional?  

Also, we might have around 120 guests, so I want to ensure that your team can handle that number comfortably. Would you be able to provide a few highlights from the menu? It would help us finalize our decision.  

Thank you for your assistance.

I appreciate your clarification request. The pricing of $75 per person does indeed include a selection of appetizers, a main course, and dessert. For the 120 guests, we can certainly accommodate that number, and our team will ensure a smooth setup and service throughout the event.  

As for the menu highlights, we have options such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a delightful chocolate mousse for dessert. We can also provide a range of salads and sides to complement the main dishes. Please let me know if you would like to see the complete menu or have any specific requests.
