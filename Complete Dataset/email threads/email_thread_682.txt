Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand you are organizing a bar mitzvah for your son, and I would love to provide you with a catering proposal.  

We specialize in creating memorable culinary experiences, and our menu features a variety of options, including meat, dairy, and mixed dishes. For bar mitzvahs, we typically recommend our traditional menu, which includes favorites such as brisket, roasted vegetables, and a selection of desserts.  

Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes setup and service staff. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that the quoted price includes VAT.  

If you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to discuss beverage options, please let me know. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information. The menu options sound great. However, I was hoping to get a bit more clarification regarding the kosher status of your offerings. Is your food certified kosher, and who oversees the supervision?  

Additionally, while I appreciate the pricing structure, would you be willing to adjust the price to $40 per person if we decide on a larger guest count? We might have up to 120 guests. Lastly, could you confirm if beverages are included in the package?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah Williams

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up questions. I can confirm that our food is kosher and under the supervision of the Star-K certification. Regarding the pricing, I can accommodate $40 per person if you commit to at least 100 guests.  

As for beverages, we typically offer a separate bar service for an additional fee, which includes a selection of soft drinks and juices. However, we can provide non-alcoholic beverages as part of the catering package if that suits your needs.  

Please let me know if you have any additional requests or if you would like to proceed with this arrangement.  

Best,

Dear David,  

I appreciate your flexibility on pricing and the kosher certification details. I’d like to go ahead and confirm the catering for 120 guests at the adjusted price of $40 per person. This will include the non-alcoholic beverages as discussed.  

Please send over the agreement, and I would like to know about the cancellation policy as well. Thank you for your assistance in making this event special for our family.  

Best regards,
