Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. At Gourmet Delights Catering, we specialize in creating memorable dining experiences tailored to your needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is set at $50 per person, and this includes a range of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and all prices include VAT.  

We also provide dietary accommodations for vegetarian, gluten-free, and nut-free options. Please let me know if you require kosher meals, as we can arrange that under strict rabbinical supervision. Beverages, however, are not included in this package but can be added upon request.  

Looking forward to your feedback so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds delightful, and I appreciate the dietary accommodations you offer. Since we expect around 100 guests, could you confirm if the price remains fixed at $50 per person?  

Additionally, can you provide more details regarding the kosher supervision? We want to ensure all our guests are comfortable with the food options. Lastly, is it possible to include a basic beverage package, and what would that add to the overall cost?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your questions. Yes, the price will remain at $50 per person for 100 guests, totaling $5,000. Our kosher meals are supervised by Rabbi Cohen, ensuring all dietary laws are strictly adhered to.  

As for the beverage package, we can add a selection of soft drinks and juices for an additional $10 per person. This would bring the total to $60 per person, or $6,000 for 100 guests, with everything included in the original VAT pricing.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and if you have any other requests regarding setup or staffing.
