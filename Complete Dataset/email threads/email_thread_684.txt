Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater for your event.  

For a gathering of this nature, we recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes an array of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. For a guest list ranging from 100 to 150 attendees, we ensure high-quality service and can accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan choices.  

Please let me know if you require kosher supervision, as we can provide options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Additionally, our pricing structure includes VAT, and we will need to finalize the guest count at least a week prior to the event for accurate planning.  

I look forward to your response so we can discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for outlining the catering options. We're expecting approximately 120 guests for the gala, and I appreciate the inclusion of dietary accommodations. However, would it be possible to adjust the pricing to $40 per person? Given our budget constraints, it would be great if we could make that work.  

Also, could you confirm if the bar service is included in that price or if it would be an additional cost? We’re considering a full bar for the event but want to ensure we stay within our budget.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your response. I understand the need to work within your budget. While I can adjust the pricing to $42 per person, the bar service would be an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

As for the menu, we can offer delicious options such as herb-roasted chicken, stuffed portobello mushrooms, and a variety of side dishes. Our kosher offerings will remain under the Orthodox Union supervision if you're interested in that route.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed to finalize the details.  

Best,
