Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide our services for this special occasion. Our catering packages can be tailored to suit your needs, and we offer a variety of menu options, including both meat and dairy selections.  

For an event of this nature, we typically recommend a mixed menu, which can include dishes such as grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, with a cost of $45 per person, which includes all food items and setup. Please note that this price does not include beverages, but we can provide a bar service at an additional cost.  

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards for your guests. Additionally, we are able to cater to various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

I would be happy to discuss this further and answer any questions you might have.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. I would like to confirm that we are expecting around 150 guests for the gala. However, I would like to negotiate the price a bit. Would you be able to offer a discount if we reach the upper limit of 200 guests?  

Also, could you clarify if the quoted price includes VAT? Lastly, we are considering including a bar service; could you provide an estimate for that as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our services and your questions. If you confirm 200 guests, we can adjust the price to $40 per person, which would bring the total to $8,000. This price does include VAT.  

For the bar service, we can offer a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks for an additional $2,000, which would include staffing and all necessary equipment. Please let me know if that works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.  

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
