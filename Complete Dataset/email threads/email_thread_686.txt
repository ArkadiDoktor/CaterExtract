Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I am interested in your menu, but I would like to discuss the pricing a little further. Given our budget constraints, would you be willing to offer a package at $40 per person? Additionally, could you confirm if the bar service is included in the initial quote or if it would be a separate charge?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your budget considerations and I'm happy to work with you. We can offer the catering at $40 per person if we streamline the menu slightly. This would still include a choice of meat and dairy dishes, but we may need to adjust some of the appetizers. The bar service is indeed an additional cost, typically around $15 per person.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over the revised menu options.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the catering at $40 per person for 100 guests, which brings the total to $4,000. Please confirm that this includes the three-course meal and any necessary staffing. I would also appreciate it if you could send over the updated menu options at your earliest convenience.  

I am aware of your cancellation policy, which I hope we won't have to consider. I look forward to your confirmation.  

Best regards,
