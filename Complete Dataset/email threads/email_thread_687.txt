Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing a range of catering options tailored to your needs.  

For your event, we offer a mixed menu that includes a selection of hors d'oeuvres, main courses, and desserts, with options to accommodate various dietary preferences. Our standard pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and service staff. We generally cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please note that prices do not include VAT, which is added on top.  

Additionally, all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary laws are met. We can also provide a full bar service, or we can exclude beverages if you prefer.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss any specific menu items or if you have any questions.

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your detailed response. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to keep the guest count on the lower end, around 60 guests. Would it be possible to adjust the pricing for that number?  

Also, could you clarify which specific dishes are included in the mixed menu? I want to ensure we cater to various tastes, especially for those with dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Samantha,  

Thanks for getting back to me. We can definitely accommodate a minimum of 60 guests. The pricing would remain at $75 per person, totaling $4,500, excluding VAT.  

As for the menu, we typically include dishes such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and various salads, along with desserts like chocolate mousse and fruit tarts. We can easily provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as well. Please let me know if you need any specific dietary accommodations.  

If everything looks good, I can send over a formal agreement along with our cancellation policy, which allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks before the event.
