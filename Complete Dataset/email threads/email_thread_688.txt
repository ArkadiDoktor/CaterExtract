Dear Rebecca,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Mark Stein, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to assist you with the catering.  

We specialize in providing a mixed menu that can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages to complement the meal, although alcoholic drinks would need to be arranged separately. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu items in mind.  

Best regards,  
Mark Stein

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable for our budget. Could you provide a more detailed menu, including some highlights? We are expecting around 100 guests, but we want to keep the option open for more, depending on RSVPs. Also, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes the bar service as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rebecca,  

I appreciate your quick reply. I can certainly send over a detailed menu. For the pricing, the $45 per person includes a three-course meal and non-alcoholic beverages. If you'd like to include a bar service, we can add that for an additional $15 per person.  

As for the menu highlights, we can offer items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of gourmet desserts. We can fully accommodate any dietary options you may have.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed, and I can prepare a formal agreement for you.  

Best wishes,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the menu details and clarification on the pricing structure. I would like to move forward with the catering for 100 guests at $45 per person, which will include the three-course meal and non-alcoholic beverages. We will handle the bar service separately.  

Please send over the formal agreement, and I will also need to review the cancellation policy. Looking forward to finalizing this.
