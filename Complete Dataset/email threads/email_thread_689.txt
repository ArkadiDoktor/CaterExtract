Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to clarify whether the pricing includes beverages, as we are considering offering drinks at the event. Additionally, could you confirm the cancellation policy? We might need to finalize the guest count closer to the event date, and I want to ensure we have flexibility.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. The price I mentioned does not include beverages, as we usually offer those as an additional service. We can provide a full bar or a selection of soft drinks, depending on your preferences.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we can allow changes up to one week before the event without any penalties. After that, we would retain a 20 percent deposit should you need to cancel.  

I hope this helps clarify things. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best regards,

Based on our estimated guest count of 150, the total will be $6,750, which I understand includes VAT. Please confirm that this covers a mixed menu and that we can adjust the final count up to one week prior to the event.  

I look forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the details.
