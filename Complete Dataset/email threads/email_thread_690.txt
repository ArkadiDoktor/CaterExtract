For your event, we typically work with a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes an array of options from our mixed menu, featuring both meat and dairy dishes. We ensure that all our food is kosher and under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping you could provide more details about the menu options available. We have some guests with dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian needs, and I want to ensure we can accommodate them.  

Additionally, could you clarify if the $45 price includes VAT? Also, does this cover beverages, or should we consider those separately?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. Our $45 price does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. As for beverages, we typically do not include them in our catering packages unless specified. However, we can offer a beverage package that includes soft drinks and wine for an additional $15 per person.  

Regarding the menu, we can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian options. Some highlights include roasted vegetable platters and a variety of salads. If you confirm the guest count, I can prepare a more tailored menu proposal for you.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarification. After discussing with my fiancé, we would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests, which brings the total to $6,000, including VAT but excluding beverages. We are fine to add the beverage package for an additional $1,500.  

Please confirm that you will hold this date for us, and I would also appreciate it if you could send over the cancellation policy. I’m looking forward to working together to make our wedding a wonderful event.  

Best wishes,
