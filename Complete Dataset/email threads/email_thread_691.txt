Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to our clients' needs, and I believe we can offer a fantastic menu for your event.  

We typically charge $75 per person for our mixed menu, which includes a variety of meat and dairy dishes, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. Our prices are inclusive of VAT, and we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. Additionally, we offer a selection of beverages, though these would be an extra cost.  

If you're interested, I would be happy to send over a sample menu and discuss any specific dietary requirements or preferences you might have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the initial details. The gala is definitely going to be a significant occasion for us. I appreciate the mixed menu options and the kosher certification.  

However, I would like to know if there is any flexibility in the pricing, as we are working within a tighter budget. Could we discuss a fixed price for 75 guests that might accommodate our needs? Additionally, we need to assure that the menu provides options for gluten-free and vegetarian guests.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand your budgetary concerns and appreciate your interest in accommodating dietary restrictions.  

I can offer a revised price of $70 per person for the 75 guests, which would bring the total to $5,250. This price includes VAT and would still provide a diverse menu with options for gluten-free and vegetarian guests. We will ensure that the setup includes staff for service and any necessary equipment.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare the specific menu items for your review.  

Best regards,
