Dear Olivia,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our team specializes in a variety of menu options, and we can accommodate up to 150 guests.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring appetizers like smoked salmon canapés and vegetarian spring rolls, main courses such as herb-roasted chicken and stuffed bell peppers, and a selection of desserts. We can also provide kosher options under the supervision of the Vaad Harabonim if needed.  

Our pricing typically starts at 45 dollars per person, inclusive of VAT. If you require beverages, we can discuss those options separately. Please let me know if you have specific dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Looking forward to your thoughts!  

Best regards,

Hi Samantha,  

Thanks for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic! I’d like to clarify a couple of points. We are expecting between 100 and 150 guests, so could you confirm the final price if we go with 125 guests? Also, we will need kosher meals, and how would that affect the overall cost?  

It's also important for us to include a bar service for our guests. Could you provide some details on that as well?  

Best,

Hi Olivia,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For 125 guests, the total would come to 5,625 dollars, which includes VAT. The kosher meals would not change that price, and we will ensure they meet the Vaad Harabonim standards.  

Regarding the bar service, we offer a package that includes a selection of wines and spirits for an additional 15 dollars per person. This would bring the total to 6,750 dollars. Please let me know if this works for your budget, and we can finalize the details.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,
