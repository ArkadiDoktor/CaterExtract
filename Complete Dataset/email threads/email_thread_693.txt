Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out about catering for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th at the Grand Hotel. We would be delighted to assist you with this occasion. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and would be happy to provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the specific dishes you select. This includes all setup and staffing for the event, and we can accommodate up to 200 guests. We also offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, should that be a requirement for your attendees.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or specific menu items.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information about your offerings. Given our guest count, we anticipate around 150 attendees, and I would like to confirm that the pricing includes VAT. Additionally, we would like to ensure a bar is included in the package.  

Could you provide a sample menu with some highlights? I am particularly interested in options that accommodate dietary restrictions, as we have several guests with specific needs.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. I can confirm that our pricing does include VAT. For your event, we can offer a bar package at an additional $15 per person, which would provide a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

I will send over a sample menu shortly, but I can highlight that we usually include dishes like herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a selection of salads. We certainly can accommodate dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free and vegan options.  

If you decide to proceed, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like to move forward with the arrangements.  

Best,
