Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding reception on April 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special occasion for you. Our offerings include a delicious selection of mixed menu options, including both meat and vegetarian dishes, which can be tailored to suit your guests' dietary needs.

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, typically ranging from $50 to $80, depending on the specific menu choices you select. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. All our food is certified kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification, ensuring it meets the highest standards.

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a tasting or if you have any specific requests regarding the menu or any beverages, as our packages generally exclude bar services.

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information provided. I’m particularly interested in the per-person pricing and would like to ensure that we stay within a budget of around $65 per guest. Can you provide me with a sample menu that fits within this price range?

Also, could you clarify if VAT is included in this pricing? Additionally, we would need to accommodate some guests with gluten-free requirements, so it would be helpful to know what options are available.

Thanks again for your assistance.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I understand your budget concerns and am happy to work with you to create a suitable menu. I can propose a delicious selection that includes options like roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and quinoa salad, all priced at $65 per person, which includes VAT.

For gluten-free accommodations, we can offer a variety of dishes that meet those needs. Regarding beverages, we can discuss options for a bar service if that’s something you would like to include.

Please confirm the number of guests you expect, and we can finalize the details. Our cancellation policy allows for changes up to one week before the event. 

Looking forward to hearing from you.
