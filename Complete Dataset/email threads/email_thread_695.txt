Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Michael Levin, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a bar mitzvah on November 15th, and I would love to provide our catering services for this special occasion.  

We offer a diverse menu featuring both meat and dairy options, and all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a variety of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and I can assure you that all dietary restrictions can be handled, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific requests for the menu.  

Best regards,  
Michael Levin

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to keep the budget closer to $40 per person. Additionally, could you clarify if the VAT is included in your pricing? We are also considering whether to include a bar service; could you provide details on that as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing. I can adjust our offer to $40 per person, but this would limit some of the premium menu items. The VAT is included in that price. As for the bar service, we offer a separate package that starts at $25 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

If you’re open to slightly increasing the guest count to a minimum of 120, I can provide a more extensive menu featuring dishes such as brisket, roasted vegetables, and assorted pastries. Please let me know your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to confirm the catering for 120 guests at $40 per person, which includes VAT. We will also go ahead with the bar service at $25 per person. Please ensure that all food is prepared under the Orthodox Union supervision as discussed.  

Could you also provide the cancellation policy? I want to ensure everything is clear before we finalize this.  

Best regards,
