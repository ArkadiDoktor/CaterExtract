Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided. I would like to clarify a few points before making a decision.  

First, while I am interested in your menu, I would like to see if we can negotiate the price down to $40 per person. Additionally, we might have up to 150 guests. Can you confirm if beverages are included in your pricing? We also need to accommodate a few dietary restrictions, particularly vegan options.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your message. I understand your concerns regarding pricing and dietary options. I can offer you the $40 per person rate if we can secure a minimum of 100 guests. Regarding beverages, we can provide a bar package separately, as it is not included in the base price.  

I can assure you we have excellent vegan options available to accommodate your guests' needs. Please let me know if this works for you, and I will send over a detailed menu.  

Best regards,
