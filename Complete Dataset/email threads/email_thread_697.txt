Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your wedding on June 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We would love to help make your special day memorable. Our catering service offers a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes.  

We typically charge per person, with our packages starting at $75 per guest, which includes setup and staff service. We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests, and all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union. We also provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar service is not included in the base package.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary needs, and I would be happy to discuss how we can accommodate them. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The $75 per person rate sounds reasonable, but I would like to discuss the option of a more budget-friendly menu since we are expecting around 150 guests. Would you be able to offer a range of pricing or perhaps a fixed price option that might fit our needs better?  

Additionally, could you confirm if the beverage selection includes soft drinks and juices? If we decide to include a bar, what would the additional costs look like?  

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. We can certainly provide a more budget-friendly menu that starts at $65 per person, which would still include a variety of our popular dishes. This option would work well for your guest count of around 150.  

Regarding beverages, our standard package includes soft drinks and juices, but if you wish to include a full bar, it would add an extra $15 per person. Please let me know if this meets your expectations, and I can prepare a more detailed menu for your review.  

Best wishes,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility with the pricing and menu options. I would like to proceed with the $65 per person rate for 150 guests, which totals to $9,750. Please confirm if this price includes VAT and the cancellation terms. I’d also appreciate a detailed menu for our review, including the dietary accommodations.  

Looking forward to finalizing this soon.  

Best,
