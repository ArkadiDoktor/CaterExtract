Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Gala

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for the community gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in a variety of menu styles and can provide a full-service experience, including setup and staffing. 

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing starts at thirty dollars per person, which includes VAT. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests, with a maximum of 200 to ensure the best service. 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or have any dietary requirements we should consider.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,  
James

Hi James,

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details provided. I am particularly interested in ensuring that we can accommodate kosher dietary needs for our attendees. Could you confirm if your menu can be certified kosher and under what supervision?

Additionally, I would like to discuss the bar service options. Are beverages included in your initial pricing, or would that be an additional cost? 

Looking forward to your clarification on these points.

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your questions. I’m pleased to confirm that our menu can be made kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Regarding beverages, we can include a bar service at an additional ten dollars per person, which would cover a selection of wines and soft drinks.

If you decide to go with our catering service, the final price for 150 guests, including bar service, would be a total of six thousand dollars. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event date.

Please let me know if this works for you or if you need further adjustments.

Best,  
James
