Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on December 10th at the Grand Ballroom. We are excited about the opportunity to cater for your event.  

Our catering services can accommodate between 100 to 300 guests, and we offer a mixed menu designed to please a variety of palates. The pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing. We can ensure that the dishes are kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Rabbinical Council, and we can also provide dietary accommodations for vegetarian and gluten-free options if needed.  

Please note that our pricing does not include beverages or a bar service, but we can assist with recommendations for beverage providers if desired. The final pricing includes VAT.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests for the menu.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but given our budget constraints, would it be possible to negotiate the price to $65 per person? Additionally, could you provide some examples of the menu items you typically serve? We want to ensure they align with our attendees' preferences.  

Also, we are considering adding a bar service. If we decide to go that route, could you provide a separate quote for that?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your feedback. While I understand your budget concerns, I can offer a revised price of $70 per person, which still allows us to maintain the quality of our offerings and service. Regarding the menu, we typically serve dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a fresh garden salad, among others.  

If you choose to include a bar service, I can provide a package starting at $25 per person, which includes a selection of wines and beers. Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I'm happy to accept your revised offer of $70 per person for the catering, and I’d like to include the bar service at $25 per person as well. This will fit well within our budget.  

Could you please confirm the total cost based on 200 guests and send over the contract? I’d also like to clarify that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we cancel two weeks prior to the event.  

Looking forward to finalizing this!  

Best,
