Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our catering services can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and we offer a range of menu options featuring a mix of meat and dairy dishes.  

Our pricing structure is $60 per person, which includes VAT. We can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority, and we are happy to discuss specific dietary accommodations, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options.  

Please let us know if you would like to include a bar service, as it is not included in the base price. Additionally, we can assist with setup and staffing if needed. I look forward to your response to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a couple of things. We expect around 100 guests, and it would be great to include a bar service if possible. What would the adjusted price be with that included? Additionally, could you provide more details on the menu options available? We want to ensure we can accommodate various dietary needs.  

Thank you for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. With 100 guests, including a bar service, the total would come to $7,000, which covers all food and beverage options, along with VAT. Our menu typically features dishes like grilled salmon, beef brisket, and roasted vegetables, and we can certainly accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free requests.  

If you confirm by the end of the week, I can hold the date for you. The cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled up to three weeks prior to the event. Please let me know if you would like to proceed, or if you have any further questions.  

Best,
