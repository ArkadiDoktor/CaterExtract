Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding your request for catering services for the upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We specialize in a diverse range of menus, and I believe we can offer a delightful experience for your guests.  

Our standard pricing starts at $50 per person for a mixed menu that includes meat and vegetarian options. We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests, and please note that this price includes VAT. We also offer kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring dietary requirements are met.  

If you would like to include a bar service, we can discuss that as well, though it is priced separately. Additionally, we can provide options for gluten-free and vegan dishes if needed.  

I would be happy to send over a sample menu for your review. Please let me know your thoughts or any specific requirements you might have.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining your offerings. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to explore any potential flexibility, considering we will likely have around 150 guests. Would you be able to provide a more competitive rate if we could confirm the booking soon?  

Also, could you clarify if the $50 per person includes the bar service, or is that an additional cost? We are looking to keep the overall budget manageable, especially with the additional expenses expected at the event.  

I appreciate your help and look forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the need for budget considerations. If we lock in your guest count at 150, I can offer a revised rate of $45 per person, which would keep the total at $6,750. Please note that this price does not include bar service, which we can provide for an additional $15 per person.  

Regarding the menu, our mixed options include dishes like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads and sides. We can also accommodate specific dietary requests, ensuring all guests feel welcome.  

Let me know if this adjusted proposal works for you, or if there are any other details you would like to discuss.  

Best wishes,

Hi Jonathan,  

I appreciate your willingness to adjust the pricing. The new rate of $45 per person is acceptable, and I would like to confirm the booking for 150 guests at that price, making the total $6,750. I understand that bar service is additional, so we will proceed without it for now.  

Please send over the contract and any details regarding setup and staffing. I would also like to confirm the cancellation policy to ensure we have everything in place. Looking forward to working together!  

Best,  
Sarah Miller
