Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering services for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals and exceptional service, and we would love to assist in making your event memorable.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options to accommodate various dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200.  

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a range of beverages, including a selection of wines and soft drinks, if that aligns with your event theme. Please let me know if you have any specific menu requests or dietary accommodations.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details you've provided. The price of $75 per person seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm if that includes VAT or if it will be added separately. Additionally, while I appreciate the mixed menu, could you clarify if you can provide gluten-free options, as we have a few guests with dietary restrictions?  

I also wanted to ask about your cancellation policy in case any unforeseen circumstances arise as we get closer to the event date.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $75 per person does include VAT, so there won't be any additional charges on that front. I can confirm that we do offer gluten-free options and can ensure that any dietary restrictions are accommodated.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we require at least 14 days' notice for a full refund, but we can discuss a partial refund for shorter notice if necessary. I hope this helps clarify everything for you.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details soon.  

Best,

Please prepare a contract outlining everything we discussed, including the setup and staffing requirements, and send it over at your earliest convenience. I look forward to working together to make this event a success.
