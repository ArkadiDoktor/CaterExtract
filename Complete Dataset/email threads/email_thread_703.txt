Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming charity gala on March 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We would be delighted to cater this special event. Our team specializes in creating memorable dining experiences, and we can provide a diverse menu tailored to your guests' preferences.  

We typically offer a variety of options, including meat, dairy, and pareve dishes. Additionally, our food is kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal, setup, and staffing. For events like yours, we recommend a minimum of 100 guests and can accommodate up to 250.

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but could you clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT? Also, we are considering adding a beverage package and would like to know if that is possible. Our guest list is currently at 150, but we might go up to 200. Additionally, we would appreciate more details about the menu, as we have some guests with dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your questions. The $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final price. We can certainly provide a beverage package for an additional $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and non-alcoholic beverages.  

Regarding the menu, we can offer options for gluten-free and vegetarian guests, and some highlighted dishes include roasted chicken with seasonal vegetables and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert. If we finalize the guest count at 150, the total would be $11,250 plus VAT, and the cancellation policy would allow for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.  

Please let me know if you need any further information.
