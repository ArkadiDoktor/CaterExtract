Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. We are indeed expecting around 100 guests for our event. I would like to confirm if the menu can be kosher, as that is a necessity for our gathering. Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the pricing?  

If possible, I would like to see a sample menu or a few highlights of the dishes you offer. I believe we can finalize the selections soon if we can align on these key points.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your reply. We can certainly provide a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary laws are adhered to. Regarding the bar service, that is not included in the base price but can be arranged for an additional fee.  

I will send over a sample menu shortly, highlighting some of our most popular dishes. For a gathering of 100 guests, the final price would be $6,000, which includes VAT but excludes the bar service.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further adjustments in mind.  

Best,
