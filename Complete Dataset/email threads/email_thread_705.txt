Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand that you are planning a corporate gala on October 15th and are looking for catering services. We would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

Our catering options include a mixed menu featuring a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring a variety of options for all dietary needs. Additionally, we can include a beverage bar for an extra charge.  

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I am particularly interested in the mixed menu, as it should cater well to our diverse group. However, I would like to confirm if you can accommodate specific dietary requests, such as gluten-free and vegan options.  

Also, could you clarify whether the $75 per person is the final price, or if there might be additional costs for setup and staffing? We are expecting about 120 guests, so any flexibility in pricing could help as well.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your questions. We can absolutely provide gluten-free and vegan options as part of our menu. Regarding the pricing, the $75 per person does cover the meal and includes VAT, but setup and staffing will be an additional $1,500. I can offer a slight discount if you confirm the order by the end of this week, bringing the total to $70 per person.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I’ll ensure that everything is in place for your event.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying everything. I appreciate your flexibility with the pricing. I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests at the adjusted rate of $70 per person, which will total $8,400. Please confirm that this includes the dietary accommodations we've discussed and that the cancellation policy allows for changes until one week before the event.  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the details.  

Best,
