Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event on November 15th. We specialize in catering for corporate gatherings, and I would love to assist you in making it a success. Our standard pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes a variety of dishes that can cater to different dietary needs. We typically accommodate groups of 50 to 200 guests.  

All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a mixed menu featuring meat dishes, vegetarian options, and pareve selections. We also offer a selection of beverages, although please note that a bar service is not included in the base price.  

If you have any specific requirements or preferences for the menu, please let me know, and I can provide you with a sample menu.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided, and I would like to explore the menu options further. We are expecting around 150 guests, and I want to ensure we can accommodate some dietary restrictions, such as vegan and gluten-free options.  

Regarding the pricing, could we negotiate a fixed price if we reach the upper limit of 200 guests? Additionally, I would like to confirm whether VAT is included in your quoted price or if it will be added separately.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that our pricing does not include VAT, which would be added at the current rate of 20%. If you reach the maximum of 200 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $8,000 total, which accommodates all your menu selections and dietary needs, including vegan and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a draft contract along with a sample menu for your review.
