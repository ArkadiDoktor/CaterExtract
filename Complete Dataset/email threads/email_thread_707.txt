Hi David,  
Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds delightful, and I appreciate the kosher certification. We are expecting around 120 guests, and I would like to know if the pricing includes VAT or if it's added on top of the quoted amount. Additionally, we are considering including a bar service, so could you provide more details on that?  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  
I’m glad to hear that you’re interested in our catering services. The pricing I provided does not include VAT, which is an additional 20 percent. Regarding the bar service, we can offer a full bar option starting at 25 dollars per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

If you decide to move forward with the catering, the total cost for 120 guests would be approximately 9,000 dollars, including the catering but excluding the bar. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least 30 days in advance. Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any other questions.
