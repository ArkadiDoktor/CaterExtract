Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this special event. Our team specializes in providing high-quality meals, and we can offer a diverse menu suited for your attendees.  

We typically charge $50 per person for our full service, which includes a three-course meal, setup, and staff. This price includes VAT. We can accommodate anywhere from 100 to 200 guests. If you have specific dietary requirements, please let us know, as we can offer vegetarian, gluten-free, and kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council.  

Additionally, our menu can include meat, dairy, or a mix depending on your preference. Please also note that beverages and a bar service can be arranged separately.  

I look forward to your feedback and discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to know if there is any flexibility on the per-person rate, especially since we are hoping to accommodate a larger guest list.  

Also, can you confirm whether the menu can be adjusted to include additional kosher options? We want to ensure our guests feel fully accommodated. Lastly, could you provide more information on your cancellation policy in case of unforeseen changes?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need for flexibility. I can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person if we have a minimum of 150 guests confirmed. Regarding the kosher options, we can certainly adjust the menu to include more choices based on your guests’ needs.  

As for cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks before the event for a full refund, but we can discuss alternative arrangements if the situation arises.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you.  

Best,
