Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the initial details. The pricing you mentioned sounds reasonable, but I'd like to confirm whether that price includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, we are expecting around 150 guests, but we’d like to keep the option open for a maximum of 200 if possible.  

Could you also clarify whether your package includes a bar service? We might want to offer a selection of wines and beers during the event. I appreciate your help with this, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

As for the menu, we can offer a selection that includes items such as roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a delightful vegetarian lasagna. We also have options for guests with dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan dishes. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations, and we can finalize the details.
