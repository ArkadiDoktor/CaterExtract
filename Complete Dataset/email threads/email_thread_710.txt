We specialize in a mixed menu that can include options such as grilled salmon, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. All our meals can be prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring compliance with dietary needs. We also offer a variety of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes VAT. Beverages are not included in this price, but we can arrange a bar service if desired.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed information. The menu options sound wonderful. However, I noticed that the pricing might be a bit above our budget, especially since we are expecting around 75 guests. Is there any flexibility in the pricing structure, considering our numbers?  

Additionally, could you clarify if there's a cancellation policy in place? I want to ensure that we have everything covered if any unforeseen circumstances arise.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. For your group of 75 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person, which would bring the total to $3,000, inclusive of VAT. Regarding cancellation, we typically require a 14-day notice for a full refund. After that, we can offer a 50% refund up to 7 days before the event.  

If this works for you, we can proceed with the planning and finalize the menu. Please let me know your thoughts.  

Best,

I think the adjusted rate works well for our budget, and I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our needs. Let's move forward with the $3,000 package for 75 guests, and I would like to confirm that we will include the bar services as well.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize the details.
