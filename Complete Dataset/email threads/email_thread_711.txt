Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your wedding on October 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special occasion. Our menu offers a delightful selection of dishes, featuring a mix of meat and dairy options, ensuring that all your guests will find something they enjoy.  

For a wedding, we typically suggest a pricing structure of $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal. This price is inclusive of VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the local rabbinical council.  

Please let us know if you would like to include a beverage package, as we currently offer separate bar options. Additionally, we can provide various dietary accommodations upon request.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the kosher certification and the flexibility with dietary needs. However, I was wondering if there’s any room for negotiation on the per-person price, as we are trying to stay within a tighter budget. Would you be able to adjust that to $65 per person?  

Also, can you confirm if the $75 price includes the necessary setup and staffing for the evening? I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and for sharing your budget constraints. I understand the importance of staying within budget and can adjust the price to $70 per person. This includes professional staffing and the necessary setup for the event.  

As for the beverage package, I would recommend considering it, as we have some excellent options that can elevate your guests' experience. If you decide to include it, we can work out a special rate for you.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.

I appreciate your flexibility on the pricing and the inclusion of staffing. I’m happy to confirm the deal at $70 per person for 120 guests, which comes to a total of $8,400, inclusive of VAT. Please proceed with the arrangements as discussed. We will forgo the bar package for now but may revisit that later.  

Could you please send over the contract and any necessary details regarding the cancellation policy? Thank you for your assistance in making this wedding a memorable event.
