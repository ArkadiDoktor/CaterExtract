Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to offer our catering services for the occasion. We specialize in a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, ensuring your guests have an enjoyable experience.

Our pricing is structured at $50 per person, which includes a full buffet featuring a selection of meats, vegetarian options, and dessert. We can serve a minimum of 50 guests and can cater up to 150. Please note that our prices include VAT, and we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.

Additionally, we can handle the setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly throughout the event. Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or require any specific menu items.

Best regards,

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details. The gala is indeed important to us, and I appreciate your offer. I would like to confirm that the menu will be kosher, as most of our attendees observe dietary restrictions. Can you clarify if your vegetarian options are also kosher?

I also wanted to check if beverages are included in the $50 per person pricing or if that’s separate. We’d like to ensure we have a full experience for our guests. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for following up. Yes, our vegetarian options are indeed kosher as well, and they are prepared under the same supervision as our meat dishes. Regarding beverages, the $50 price does not include a bar service. However, we can provide a range of beverage options for an additional $15 per person, which includes soft drinks and a selection of wines.

If that works for you, I can prepare a detailed proposal including all menu highlights. Just let me know the final guest count once you have it.

Best,

I’m looking forward to working with you to create a memorable evening for our guests.
