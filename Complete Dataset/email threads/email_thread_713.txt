Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisine types and can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For this event, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes options for both meat and dairy, ensuring there is something for everyone. Our standard pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal, appetizers, and dessert. This price is inclusive of VAT, and we can serve between 50 to 150 guests.  

Additionally, I would like to confirm that our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a selection of beverages for an additional cost. Please let me know if you have any specific requests or dietary accommodations.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the details provided. I'm glad to hear about the mixed menu and kosher supervision. However, I’m wondering if there's any flexibility with the pricing, as we are working with a somewhat tighter budget. Would you be able to offer a discount if we confirm a guest count closer to the minimum of 50?  

Also, could you clarify if the beverages are included in the $75 per person fee, or would they be an additional cost?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to stay within budget. We can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person if you can guarantee the minimum of 50 guests. Regarding the beverages, they are not included in the $75 package, but we can provide a tailored beverage package starting at an additional $15 per person.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I'll prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

I appreciate your flexibility and the revised pricing. After reviewing our budget and guest expectations, I would like to proceed with the catering at $70 per person for 50 guests, which brings us to a total of $3,500. Please include the beverage package as well. I understand the cancellation policy is standard, and we will provide a confirmation by next week.  

Thank you for your assistance in making this event a success!  

Warm regards,
