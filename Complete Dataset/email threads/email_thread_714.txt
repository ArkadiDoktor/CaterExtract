Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. Our standard offering includes a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and vegetarian options to accommodate different dietary preferences.  

We typically charge £45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This price also covers setup and staffing. For your event, we would recommend a minimum of 30 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests if needed.  

All our food is kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din, and we can provide a separate bar service at an additional cost. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements that we should consider.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thanks for the quick response and the detailed proposal. The £45 per person seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm if VAT is included in that price or if it will be added later. Additionally, our guest count might fluctuate, so could you share your cancellation policy if we need to make adjustments?  

Also, we are considering a bar for the evening. What would the additional cost look like, and what drink options do you typically provide?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your queries. The price of £45 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a final headcount two weeks before the event. Cancellations made within this period will incur a 50% fee.  

As for the bar, we typically offer a range of drinks including wine, beer, and soft drinks, with a package starting at £15 per person. If you can provide me with an estimated number of guests, I can give you a more accurate quote for the bar service.  

Please let me know if you need any further clarification.  

Best regards,
