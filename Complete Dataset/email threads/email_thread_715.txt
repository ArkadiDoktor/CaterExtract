Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher catering services and would be delighted to work with you on this special occasion.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of dishes, including grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. Our standard pricing is $75 per person, which includes all food and setup. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests comfortably.  

All our food is under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest kosher standards. Please note that our pricing does not include beverages or a bar service, but we can help arrange those if needed. VAT is included in the quoted price.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific dietary requirements we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the catering proposal. I appreciate the details you provided. I wanted to confirm if you can accommodate some dietary restrictions, specifically vegetarian and gluten-free options, as we have a few guests who will require those.  

Also, while I understand that the price is $75 per person, is there any flexibility if we increase the guest count or adjust menu items? We are expecting around 125 guests, but the final count may vary.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah Thompson

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. We can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free options to ensure all your guests are accommodated.  

Regarding the pricing, if you increase the guest count to 125, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person for that number, with a minimum of 100 guests. The final price would then be $8,750, which includes VAT. However, if the guest count exceeds 150, we would need to reassess.  

Please let me know if this works for you so we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
