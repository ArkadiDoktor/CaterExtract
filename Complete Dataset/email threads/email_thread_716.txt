Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a bar mitzvah on November 15th, and we would be delighted to assist you with the catering.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including a kosher menu supervised by the Orthodox Union, featuring dishes such as brisket, chicken, and a selection of side dishes. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed rate of $50 per person, which includes setup and staffing, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

Please note that our prices include VAT, but beverages and a bar service would be an additional cost if you wish to include them. We can also accommodate various dietary needs.  

Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed information. The menu sounds enticing, particularly the brisket and chicken options. However, we were hoping to keep the budget at around $40 per person. Is there any flexibility in pricing, perhaps with a slightly modified menu?  

Additionally, could you confirm whether the $50 includes all necessary equipment for serving? I would also like to know if you can accommodate a gluten-free option for some guests.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. While our standard pricing is $50 per person, I can offer a modified menu that would bring the cost down to $45 per person. This would include a choice of one meat dish, two sides, and a salad, while still maintaining the kosher supervision you require.  

As for the equipment, we do provide all necessary serving utensils and tableware as part of our service. We can also accommodate gluten-free options for your guests.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised proposal. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu and the accommodations for gluten-free options. The adjusted price of $45 per person sounds reasonable, and I would like to move forward with the agreement for 100 guests, which totals $4,500.  

Please confirm that this includes VAT, and I would like to clarify that we will not be including a bar service, as we wish to keep the budget tight. I understand the cancellation policy allows for adjustments up to two weeks before the event, which works for us as well.  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,
