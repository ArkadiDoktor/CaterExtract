Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our standard pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a full buffet service. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and our menu features a mixed selection of dishes that can cater to various dietary preferences.  

All of our food is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union. As for beverages, we can provide a bar service at an additional cost if desired. I can send over a detailed menu and some representative dishes for your review. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary accommodations in mind, and I can ensure we include those in our planning.  

I look forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. I’m wondering if there's any flexibility in your pricing, as we're looking to keep costs within a certain range. Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT, or if that will be added later?  

I also wanted to confirm that you can accommodate a vegetarian option in the menu. Please send over a sample menu at your earliest convenience so we can review it with the team.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. While our standard rate is $75 per person, I can offer a revised package at $70 per person if we finalize the details by the end of this week. The price does include VAT, so there won’t be any surprises later on.  

We can certainly provide vegetarian options; I’ll ensure those are included in the sample menu. Would you like me to send the menu over by tomorrow? Let me know if there are any additional considerations we should keep in mind.  

Best wishes,
