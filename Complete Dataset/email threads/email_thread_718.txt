Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your inquiry about catering services for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food and service for events of this nature.  

For a gala, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring there is something for everyone. Our pricing starts at $65 per person, which includes a full buffet setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests for this event.  

Please note that our prices are inclusive of VAT. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under strict rabbinical supervision if this is a requirement for your guests. I would be happy to discuss specific dietary accommodations or any other preferences you might have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and detailed information. I appreciate the inclusivity of your pricing. However, I was hoping to keep our budget a bit tighter. Would you be able to lower the price to $60 per person while maintaining the quality of food and service?  

Additionally, can you clarify if beverages are included in that price, or will they be an extra cost? We are expecting around 150 guests, and I want to ensure everything fits seamlessly into our plans.  

Thanks again for your assistance.

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your budget considerations and understand the need to optimize costs. I can offer you the price of $60 per person, provided that we confirm a guest count of at least 100 guests. This will still allow us to deliver a fantastic menu including favorites like herb-roasted chicken and a selection of seasonal vegetables.  

Regarding beverages, I can include non-alcoholic drinks in the package, but alcoholic beverages would be an additional cost. We can discuss options for a bar setup as well if you're interested.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I would be happy to finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your flexibility. The adjusted price of $60 per person works for us, and we will commit to 150 guests. I appreciate the inclusion of non-alcoholic beverages and would like to discuss a bar option separately.  

The final price would be $9,000, correct? I would also like to confirm that all meals will be kosher under your supervision. I understand the cancellation policy is flexible, given the circumstances, so please provide that for our records.  

Looking forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Best,
