We typically offer a fixed price of $60 per person, which includes a three-course meal, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards of quality. The menu features a mix of meat and dairy options, along with vegetarian dishes, and we can accommodate dietary restrictions upon request.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The fixed price of $60 per person sounds reasonable, but I was hoping we could negotiate to bring it down to $55 per person, given that we might be closer to the minimum guest count. Also, could you clarify if the price includes VAT, and whether beverages or a bar are part of the package?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. I can offer the price of $55 per person if you can confirm at least 100 guests. The pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total. Additionally, our standard package does not include a bar; however, we can arrange a beverage package at an extra cost if you're interested.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
