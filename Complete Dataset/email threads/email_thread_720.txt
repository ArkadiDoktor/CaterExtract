Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a wedding reception on April 15th, and I would love to assist you with the catering.  

We specialize in a variety of menu options and can provide a mixed menu that accommodates both meat and dairy preferences. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

Additionally, all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK Kosher Certification, ensuring that it meets all dietary requirements. We can also accommodate guests with allergies upon request. Beverages are not included in the pricing but can be added if you wish.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific preferences or questions.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for detailing your catering options. The mixed menu sounds great, but I was hoping to know if you could lower the price slightly, as our budget is a bit tight. Would you be able to offer a rate closer to $65 per person?  

Additionally, could you clarify if the setup and staffing are included in your package, or would that be an extra cost? It’s important for us to have everything in place smoothly for our guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your response and understand your budget concerns. While I can offer a lower price of $70 per person, I must inform you that this rate still includes VAT and covers the basic setup and staffing for the event.  

If that works for you, I can provide a representative menu that includes items like herb-roasted chicken, a selection of seasonal vegetables, and a variety of fresh salads. We can finalize the details upon your confirmation.  

Please let me know if this adjusted price meets your expectations.  

Warm regards,

Please confirm that the menu will include the dishes we discussed, and let’s finalize the details surrounding the beverages as well. I want to ensure everything runs smoothly for the wedding reception.
