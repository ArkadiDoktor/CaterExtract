Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for considering The Gourmet Caterers for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in large events and would be thrilled to provide our services. Our menu features a delightful selection of mixed meat and dairy dishes, all under strict kosher supervision by the Rabbinical Council.  

For your event, we can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, with a pricing structure of $55 per person, which includes VAT. This rate covers a three-course meal with options like herb-crusted chicken and a gourmet pasta dish, alongside a variety of salads and desserts. Please note that beverages are not included in this price, but we can arrange a bar service if needed.  

Let me know if you have specific dietary requirements, as we can certainly accommodate vegetarian or gluten-free options as well. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Cohen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, we are still assessing our budget and would like to know if there is any flexibility on the per-person price, especially if we end up with a larger guest list. Would you consider a reduced rate for a confirmed guest count over 150?  

Also, could you clarify the cancellation policy in case we need to make adjustments closer to the event date?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. I'm happy to offer a reduced rate of $50 per person if we can secure a guest count of 150 or more. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days before the event for a full refund of any deposits made.  

If you choose to proceed, we can finalize the menu and discuss any specific dietary needs at that time. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.  

Warm regards,
