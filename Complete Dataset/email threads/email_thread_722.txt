Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding on April 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We are excited to potentially be part of your special day.  

Our catering service specializes in providing a delightful culinary experience with mixed menu options, including both meat and dairy dishes. We typically structure our pricing at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This price also includes VAT.  

We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests, so we can work within your expected attendance. Additionally, we offer dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific preferences for the menu.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. I appreciate the flexibility with the guest count. We are expecting between 80 to 120 guests, so your proposal fits well.  

While I am intrigued by the $75 per person rate, I would like to explore any potential adjustments, especially regarding the menu highlights. Could we possibly consider some options that would allow us to stay within a $65 per person range? Additionally, can you confirm if the food is kosher and what supervision you have for that?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in tailoring our offerings. For the reduced price of $65 per person, we can provide a simplified menu, which would still include a selection of appetizers, one meat dish, and a dessert. All our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard packages, but we can offer a separate beverage service tailored to your needs. If you decide to go forward with the adjusted menu, the final price would be $6,500 for 100 guests. Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event.  

Let me know how this sounds.  

Best,
