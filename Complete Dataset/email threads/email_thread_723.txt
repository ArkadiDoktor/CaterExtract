Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to confirm our conversation regarding your company's upcoming annual gala on January 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special event.

We can offer a variety of menu options, including a delicious mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We recommend planning for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200 guests. In addition to the meal, we can arrange for beverage services, but please let us know if you would prefer a separate bar setup.

All our food is kosher, under strict supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets the highest standards. We can also cater to various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or make adjustments to the menu. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the details of the catering proposal. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate your flexibility in accommodating dietary restrictions. Could you provide a few highlights of the menu items you typically offer? 

Additionally, I would like to clarify if the $45 per person includes everything, or if there are additional costs I should be aware of. We are currently expecting around 150 guests, but we might increase that number depending on the final RSVPs. If we do go ahead, what is your cancellation policy?

Looking forward to your clarifications.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your quick reply. I can certainly provide an overview of the menu. Some of our popular items include herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a seasonal salad bar. 

Regarding pricing, the $45 per person includes all food and VAT, but please note that beverages are not included in that price. We can discuss options for a bar setup depending on your preferences. As for the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund. 

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
