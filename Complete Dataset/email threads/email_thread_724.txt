Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

We specialize in a variety of menus that can be tailored to suit your needs, including kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Our pricing is typically structured at $75 per person, which includes all necessary staffing and equipment for setup. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that VAT is included in our pricing.  

If you have specific dietary requirements or menu preferences, please let us know, and we will do our best to accommodate them. Some of our popular menu highlights include grilled chicken with rosemary, a vegetarian pasta primavera, and a selection of fresh salads.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details about the menu options. The pricing seems reasonable, but we are looking to keep costs in check as much as possible. Would you be able to offer a slightly lower rate, perhaps around $65 per person? Additionally, could you clarify if beverages are included in that price?  

We expect around 100 guests, but we may need to adjust that number as the date approaches. Your flexibility on the menu sounds great, and we appreciate your willingness to accommodate dietary needs.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and for providing insight into your budget. I can offer you a rate of $70 per person, which still includes the full menu and staffing. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in that price, but we can discuss options for a beverage package if that would help.  

If you decide to go ahead with our services, we can finalize the details next week. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if you cancel at least two weeks prior to the event. I hope this works for you.  

Looking forward to your decision.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am happy to confirm the catering at $70 per person for 100 guests, which totals $7,000. We will also need a beverage package included, so please provide some options for that.  

Since the event is a wedding, I want to ensure everything aligns with the kosher requirements we discussed. Once we finalize the beverage options, I will send over a deposit to secure the reservation.  

Thanks again for your assistance, and I look forward to working together.  

Best regards,
