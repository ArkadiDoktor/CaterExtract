Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the catering options for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing exquisite catering tailored to events just like yours.  

For your event, I can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of gourmet appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests, and our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. Our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision, and I can confirm that we have options available for guests with dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian choices.  

If you’d like to include a bar service, we can discuss that separately as it is not part of the base package. I suggest we set up a time to go over the details and finalize the menu.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, but I wanted to clarify the pricing a bit more. Would you be able to provide a more comprehensive list of menu items? Additionally, I am considering options for a bar service, so it would be helpful to know the costs associated with that as well.  

If we were to finalize the guest count at around 150, would you still be able to maintain the $45 per person rate? Also, could you confirm if the final price includes all setup and staffing arrangements?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly provide a detailed menu list. Our signature items include grilled chicken skewers, roasted vegetable platters, and a decadent chocolate mousse. For the bar service, we can offer a variety of drink packages starting from $20 per person.  

If you confirm 150 guests, the price remains at $45 per person, bringing the total to $6,750, which includes VAT. The setup and staffing are also covered in that price, ensuring a smooth experience for your gala. 

Please let me know if this works for you so we can proceed.
