Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for March 15th. Our team at Culinary Delights specializes in providing exquisite dining experiences, and we would love to support your event.

We typically offer a range of menu options, including a mixed menu with meat and vegetarian selections. Our pricing starts at $50 per person, which includes all setup and service staff, as well as complimentary beverages. We can comfortably accommodate anywhere from 100 to 200 guests, and our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Kashrut Authority.

Please let me know if you're interested, and I can provide a detailed menu and further options tailored to your needs.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. I would like to clarify a couple of points before we proceed. Firstly, does the $50 per person pricing include VAT? Also, can you confirm if your menu includes any specific dietary accommodations for guests with allergies or preferences? 

Additionally, I would like to know if there is any flexibility in the guest count, as we may have up to 250 guests. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your follow-up questions. The $50 per person pricing does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the final bill. As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide options for gluten-free and vegetarian meals. 

Regarding the guest count, while our pricing is based on 100 to 200 guests, we can work with you on an arrangement for 250 guests, although this may slightly increase the overall cost. 

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I can send over a sample menu for your review.

Best,
