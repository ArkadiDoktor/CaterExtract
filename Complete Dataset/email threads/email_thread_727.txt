Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on March 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We would love to cater this special occasion for you. Our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes a full buffet service with a variety of options, including meat and dairy dishes. We can accommodate anywhere from 100 to 150 guests, and our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

We do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can arrange a selection of beverages for an additional fee. We are also happy to provide dietary accommodations for any guests with specific needs. Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu options further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,  
Michael from Gourmet Events

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details you’ve provided. I appreciate that the food will be kosher certified. However, I was hoping to understand if the $75 per person includes VAT or if that would be added on top. Additionally, while I like the idea of a buffet, I would prefer to have a couple of plated options as well. Is that something you can accommodate?  

I also wanted to know if there’s flexibility in the pricing if we decide to go with a maximum of 130 guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The $75 per person does not include VAT, which would be added to the final invoice. We can certainly provide plated options along with the buffet for an additional $10 per person. If you confirm 130 guests, I can offer you a total package price of $9,750, which includes everything we discussed, plus VAT.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a draft contract outlining the details.  

Best,  
Michael
