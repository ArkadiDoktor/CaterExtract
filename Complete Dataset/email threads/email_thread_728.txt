Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming anniversary celebration on December 15th. We specialize in providing a delightful culinary experience for events like yours.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of dishes, including grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of seasonal salads. Our pricing is structured at $50 per person, and this includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests, so please let us know your expected numbers.  

If you require kosher options, we can provide meals supervised by the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can offer a beverage package, including wine and soft drinks, for an additional fee.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific dietary requirements we should consider.  

Best regards,  
Laura Green

Hi Laura,  

I appreciate your prompt response and the details you provided. The menu sounds promising, but I was hoping to clarify a few things. Could you let me know if there are any options for vegetarian dishes, as we expect some guests who might prefer that? Also, while $50 per person seems reasonable, our budget is a bit tight, so would you be able to offer a lower price if we go for a simpler menu?  

Lastly, I want to confirm if the beverage package is mandatory or can it be excluded. Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. We can certainly provide a couple of vegetarian options to accommodate your guests. Regarding the pricing, we can offer a simplified menu at $40 per person, which would still include some of our popular dishes but fewer choices overall.  

As for the beverage package, it is optional. You can choose to exclude it if you prefer to manage drinks separately.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this revised proposal. I look forward to working with you to make this event a success.  

Warm regards,

Hi Laura,  

Thanks for your flexibility regarding the menu and pricing. I think the $40 per person option with vegetarian selections is a great fit for us. Please confirm that the total would be $4,000 for 100 guests, with VAT included. I would also like to confirm that the meals will be kosher under Orthodox Union supervision.  

Let's proceed with this arrangement, and I will send over the deposit as soon as you provide the cancellation terms. I appreciate your help in organizing this, and I’m looking forward to a successful event.  

Best,
