Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing you mentioned sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify a few points. Our guest list may fluctuate between 60 and 80 attendees, and we need to ensure that the menu is kosher. Can you confirm if the offerings are under reliable supervision?  

Additionally, could you let me know if beverages are included in the price or if they are available at an extra cost? I’m also curious about your cancellation policy in case of any unexpected changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that our menu is kosher and is supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets all necessary dietary requirements.  

Regarding beverages, we do not include a bar in the initial price, but I can offer a beverage package for an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. As for the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 10 days prior to the event for a full refund.  

If this meets your needs, we can finalize the arrangement for 70 guests at a total of $3,150, inclusive of VAT. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
