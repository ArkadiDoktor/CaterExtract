Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering services for your upcoming wedding on May 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to provide our services for your special day.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes, ensuring that there is something for everyone. Our pricing starts at $85 per person, which includes a full buffet service, staff, and setup. This price is inclusive of VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and we are happy to provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or any dietary needs your guests may have. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate the detailed breakdown. However, I was hoping to discuss the price a bit more. Considering our budget constraints, would you be able to lower the price to $75 per person? Additionally, could you confirm whether beverages are included in that price?  

We are looking to finalize arrangements as soon as possible, so any flexibility you could offer would be greatly appreciated.  

Warm regards,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the importance of staying within budget. While I can offer the price of $75 per person, please note that this would exclude beverages. If you would like to include a drink package, we could discuss options that fit within the overall cost.  

We are committed to making your event special and can provide a selection of popular dishes such as herb-roasted chicken and a variety of seasonal vegetables. If this works for you, I can prepare a detailed menu and finalize the arrangements.  

Thank you for considering this proposal. I look forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. I would like to proceed with the $75 per person offer, excluding beverages. We will handle the drinks separately. Please prepare the detailed menu, including the herb-roasted chicken and any other highlights you recommend.  

As for the cancellation policy, could you confirm the terms? I want to ensure we are aligned on that before finalizing everything. Looking forward to your reply.
