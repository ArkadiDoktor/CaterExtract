Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your catering needs for the upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to our clients' requirements, and I would be delighted to assist you.  

For the event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes options for meat and dairy, and we can certainly accommodate any dietary restrictions your guests may have. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

Additionally, our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. However, please note that a bar service would be an additional cost not included in this pricing.  

If you have any specific dishes in mind or if you’d like to discuss any other details, feel free to let me know. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to know if there's any flexibility in the cost per person as we might be expecting around 120 guests. Additionally, could you provide some examples of the menu items you typically offer?  

I appreciate the kosher supervision details, and I would also like to confirm that you can provide vegetarian options for those who may not eat meat. Lastly, I would be interested in knowing more about the cancellation policy in case our plans change.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For a guest count of 120, we can offer a flat rate of $42 per person, which still includes VAT. Our menu includes items like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and seasonal salads. We can certainly provide vegetarian options as well.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we typically require a notice of at least seven days before the event for a full refund, but I can send over the detailed terms for your records. Let me know if you would like to finalize the agreement or if you have any other questions.  

Best,
