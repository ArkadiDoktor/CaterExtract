Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming business conference scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to corporate events, and I would be happy to assist you with this.

For a gathering of between 50 to 150 guests, we offer a mixed menu that includes a selection of meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing structure is set at $35 per person, which includes a full buffet setup and service. This price does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total. Additionally, we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options.

Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or have any specific requests. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit, especially considering we might have closer to 100 attendees. Can you confirm if the menu will be kosher? If so, which supervision do you follow? Also, please clarify if beverages are included in the price or if that will be an additional charge.

Looking forward to your clarification.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. Yes, our menu can be arranged to be kosher, and we follow supervision from the Orthodox Union. As for beverages, we typically offer a separate bar package, but I can include a basic selection of soft drinks and water in the per person price if that helps. 

If you are set on 100 guests, the total would then be $3,500, plus VAT. We can also discuss additional options for the bar if you’re interested. Please let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,
