Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I am particularly interested in ensuring our menu can cater to both meat and dairy preferences, as some of our guests have specific dietary needs. 

Could you confirm if the pricing of $50 per person includes VAT or if it will be added on top? Additionally, I would like to know if you can include a beverage package, as we are considering serving drinks at the event.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your follow-up. The $50 per person price does include VAT, which makes it easier for budgeting. Regarding the beverage package, we can certainly include a selection of drinks for an additional $15 per person. 

The final menu could feature items such as roast chicken, grilled vegetables, and a variety of salads. We can also accommodate kosher needs under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if you have other preferences.

Best,
