For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of appetizers, mains, and desserts. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes all food and setup. We recommend a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150. Additionally, our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I would like to clarify whether the $75 per person price includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, could you let me know what beverages might be included, as our guests will expect a bar service?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person price does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. Regarding beverages, we can offer a full bar service at an additional cost, or we can provide a selection of non-alcoholic drinks included in the catering package.  

If you are interested, I can provide a detailed list of menu items and beverage options. I believe we can work together to find a suitable arrangement that meets your needs.  

Best,
