Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering options for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs. Our offerings include a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For this event, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes setup and staff. This pricing applies to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please note that VAT will be added on top of the quoted price. We also recommend including a beverage bar, which can be arranged for an additional cost.  

We can provide a sample menu for your review, featuring items such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads. If you have specific dietary requirements, please let us know, and we will do our best to accommodate them.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details. However, our budget is a bit tighter than anticipated. Would you be able to offer a price closer to $65 per person? Additionally, could you clarify whether the drink options are included in the original quote or if they are entirely separate?  

We expect around 120 guests, and it would be great to finalize this soon. Please let me know what you can do.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand the budget constraints and appreciate your honesty. I can offer a revised price of $70 per person, which includes the buffet-style meal and a selection of non-alcoholic beverages. The beverage bar with alcohol can be added for an additional $15 per person if that interests you.  

We can definitely accommodate 120 guests for the event. Please keep in mind that our cancellation policy allows for changes up to seven days prior to the event date without penalty. Let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the final details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the adjusted pricing and the clarification regarding beverages. I would like to move forward with the $70 per person option for 120 guests, which totals $8,400. Please confirm that this includes VAT and that the menu will feature options like the herb-crusted chicken and grilled vegetable skewers. I appreciate the cancellation terms as well.  

Could you send over a contract for us to sign? Looking forward to finalizing everything.
