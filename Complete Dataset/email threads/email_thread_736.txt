Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out about catering for your upcoming conference on March 15th at the Riverfront Convention Center. We would be delighted to assist you. Our catering service specializes in providing a variety of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed selections.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes a full buffet setup, staff for serving, and cleanup. Our prices are inclusive of VAT and we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or menu preferences, and I can suggest some dishes that might fit your needs.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the information you provided. I wanted to clarify a couple of points regarding the pricing and menu options. While $45 per person is within our budget, is there any flexibility if we decide to go with a lower guest count? We might have around 80 to 120 attendees.  

Additionally, could you let me know if beverages are included in that price or if they would be an extra charge? We would prefer to have a selection of drinks available.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand your concerns regarding the guest count. If you anticipate around 80 guests, we can adjust the per-person price to $50, as we still need to cover our minimum staffing and setup costs.  

Regarding beverages, we can offer a package that includes a selection of soft drinks and juices for an additional $10 per person. If you'd prefer to include alcoholic beverages, we can discuss a bar package separately.  

Please let me know what you think, and I’ll be happy to provide a detailed menu for you to review.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. After discussing with my team, we are comfortable with your adjusted price of $50 per person for 80 guests, which includes the beverage package. I would like to proceed with a mixed menu and ensure that the kosher options are available. Please send over the detailed menu, including the cancellation policy, and let’s finalize the arrangements.  

Looking forward to your prompt reply.
