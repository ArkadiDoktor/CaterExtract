Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Culinary Delights to cater your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to our clients' needs.  

For your event, I suggest a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, ensuring there is something for everyone. We can accommodate dietary restrictions as needed, including vegetarian and gluten-free choices.  

Our pricing is structured at a rate of $45 per person, which includes VAT. We typically cater for a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150 guests. Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages for an extra cost.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the mixed menu suggestion, and I believe it will work well for our diverse group. However, I was hoping to adjust the pricing a bit. We are looking to keep costs down and would prefer a fixed price of around $40 per person if possible.  

Also, could you confirm if the food is kosher? If so, under what supervision? Lastly, could you provide more details about the beverages and whether they are included in the initial price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can certainly offer a fixed price of $40 per person, which would bring the total to $6,000 for a group of 150 guests. Yes, all food prepared will be kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a selection of soft drinks included in the package, while alcoholic beverages would be additional.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a more detailed menu for your review.  

Warm regards,
