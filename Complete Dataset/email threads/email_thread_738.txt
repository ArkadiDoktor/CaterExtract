Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Greenberg, and I am with Green Plate Caterers. I understand you are organizing a wedding reception scheduled for March 15th, and I would love the opportunity to provide catering services for your special day.  

We specialize in kosher catering and can offer a diverse menu that includes meat and dairy options, all under strict supervision from the Orthodox Union. For your event, we can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests with a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can also provide various dietary options to ensure all guests are satisfied.  

In addition to the food, we can arrange for a full bar service, or if you prefer, a selection of non-alcoholic beverages. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further, and I can send over a sample menu.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Greenberg

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information about your services. I appreciate the kosher options you offer, as this is important for many of our guests. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, is there any flexibility in the $75 per person rate?  

Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service is included in that price or if it is an additional cost? We are expecting around 120 guests, but there might be some variations as we finalize the guest list.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to stay within budget. While the standard price is $75 per person, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person if we finalize the contract by the end of this week. The bar service is not included in that price; it would be an additional $15 per person for a full selection of drinks.  

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and I can send over the revised proposal and sample menu. We are committed to making your event memorable and accommodating any special requests you may have.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your understanding and the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the $70 per person rate for 120 guests, which brings us to a total of $8,400. I also agree to the additional $15 per person for the bar service, which makes the final price $10,200. Please confirm that this includes VAT, and we can discuss the next steps.  

I look forward to working with you to make this wedding a wonderful event.  

Best,
