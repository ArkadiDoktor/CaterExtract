Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand that you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to provide catering services for this special occasion. We specialize in a range of cuisines and can accommodate up to 200 guests.  

Our pricing structure is flexible, with a base rate of £45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring a selection of meat and vegetarian options. Additionally, we can offer a kosher menu under strict supervision, ensuring that all dietary requirements are met. We also have options for guests with specific dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free and vegan dishes.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the catering proposal. I appreciate the flexibility in your menu options. However, I am looking for a more detailed breakdown. Would it be possible to adjust the price to include beverages, and could you confirm if VAT is included in your quoted rate? Also, we are expecting between 150 to 180 guests.  

I would love to see a few menu highlights, particularly if you could suggest some appealing dishes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can certainly include a selection of beverages for an additional £10 per person, which would cover both soft drinks and a limited selection of wines. The initial £45 per person does not include VAT, which is added at 20%.  

With your guest estimate in mind, I can offer a total of £10,800 for 180 guests, including the three-course meal and beverages. Our menu can feature dishes like herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable risotto, and a seasonal fruit tart, ensuring there’s something for everyone.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any other adjustments you would like to consider.  

Best regards,
