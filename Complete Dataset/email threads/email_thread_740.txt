Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate event on December 15. We specialize in a variety of catering options that I believe will suit your needs perfectly.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, including some popular choices such as grilled chicken skewers, vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads. We can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests, and our pricing structure is set at $40 per person, inclusive of VAT.  

All of our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets dietary requirements. However, we do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can arrange for one if you’re interested. We are also happy to work with you to address any specific dietary restrictions your guests might have.  

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss this further or if you have any questions.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Green

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the quick response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The menu sounds great, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in the pricing if we decide to go for the maximum number of guests? Also, could you clarify if the $40 per person includes any appetizers or desserts?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I’m glad you asked about the pricing. For the maximum of 100 guests, we can offer a total price of $3,800, which will include a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can also provide a few additional options if you have specific requests. As for the appetizers and desserts, they are included in the per person charge.  

If you decide to proceed, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks in advance. Please let me know if this works for you or if you need more adjustments.
