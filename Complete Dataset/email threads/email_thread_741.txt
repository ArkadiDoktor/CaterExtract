Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Klein, and I represent Klein Catering. I understand that you are organizing a corporate conference scheduled for March 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can assist with your catering needs.  

We specialize in a variety of menu options, including mixed cuisine, and can accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, typically ranging between $40 and $60, depending on the selected menu items. We can also ensure that all food is kosher, supervised by the local Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know the expected number of guests, as we usually cater for a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 200 attendees. I look forward to hearing back from you soon to discuss further details.  

Best regards,  
David Klein

Hi David,  

Thank you for reaching out and providing the initial details. We are expecting around 150 attendees for the conference, and I appreciate the options you mentioned. I would like to clarify if the $40 to $60 range includes VAT, as well as whether beverages will be part of the package.  

We are particularly interested in a menu that includes both meat and dairy options, with a few vegan selections for our guests with dietary restrictions. Could you let me know some specific dishes you would recommend?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your quick response. The pricing does not include VAT, which would be an additional 20%. Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar setup within our standard packages, but we can certainly arrange a beverage station at an additional cost.  

For the menu, I recommend items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platter, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can provide both meat and dairy options, and I assure you that we will accommodate vegan requests as well.  

If you decide to proceed with the proposal, I can offer a final price of $52 per person for the selected menu. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

Please send over the contract and any additional information regarding the setup and staffing. I also want to confirm your cancellation policy just in case.  

Looking forward to working together!
