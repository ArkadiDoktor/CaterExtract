Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically offer a menu featuring a mix of meat and dairy options, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a complete buffet setup with staffing and equipment. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests and can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or if you have any dietary restrictions we should consider. Additionally, we can include a bar service for an extra charge if you're interested.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the information you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT, as we need to budget accordingly.  

Also, could you confirm if you can accommodate gluten-free options? We are expecting around 120 guests, so it would be helpful to know how flexible you can be with the menu selections.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The quoted price of $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free options and can provide a range of dishes that cater to various dietary needs.  

If you decide to move forward, I can finalize a menu that includes favorites such as herb-marinated chicken and roasted vegetable platters. We can also include a bar service, priced separately, if that interests you.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can start drafting a contract.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing details. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu options. I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests, which brings the total to $9,000 plus VAT. Please draft the contract with the details we discussed, including gluten-free options and the kosher supervision.  

Could you also confirm the cancellation policy? Once I have that, we can finalize everything.  

Best,
