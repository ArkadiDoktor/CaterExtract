Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming conference on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

Our catering services can provide a diverse menu that accommodates various dietary needs. We offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options, and all our meat dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes VAT. This price covers a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. We can also offer a range of beverage options, including a full bar if that is of interest.  

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or questions, and I can provide a sample menu along with some representative dishes.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the quick response and the details you provided. The mixed menu sounds perfect for our diverse group. I wanted to confirm whether the $45 per person price includes any beverages or if we need to arrange that separately. Additionally, could you clarify your cancellation policy? It would be helpful to know how much flexibility we have should our guest count change.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt reply. The $45 per person does not include a full bar; however, we can offer a selection of non-alcoholic beverages as part of the package. For the bar service, we can provide a package starting at an additional $15 per person.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made. Should there be a change in the guest count, we can adjust the final invoice accordingly, as long as you notify us at least one week in advance.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if there are other details to discuss.  

Best,
