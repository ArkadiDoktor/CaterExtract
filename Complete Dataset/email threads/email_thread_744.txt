Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals and can offer a variety of options to suit your guests' needs.  

For an event of this nature, we recommend a mixed menu featuring appetizers, mains, and desserts, all prepared with fresh, local ingredients. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing is structured at £35 per person, which includes setup and staffing. This rate covers a minimum of 50 guests and can extend up to 150 guests. Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu or if you have any specific preferences.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to discuss any possible adjustments since our budget is a bit tight. Would you be able to lower the per person rate to £30 if we confirm 75 guests? Additionally, could you clarify if VAT is included in your pricing?  

I appreciate your flexibility, and I’m eager to see the sample menu.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your understanding. I can agree to the £30 per person rate for 75 guests, and this pricing includes VAT. Our menu features options such as grilled salmon, roasted vegetable tart, and a selection of gourmet desserts.  

Regarding the kosher requirements, we can provide a kosher menu supervised by the London Beth Din. However, I need to clarify that beverages and a bar service are not included in this price.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed or have any other questions.  

Best,
