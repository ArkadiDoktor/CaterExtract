Hi Matthew,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The price per person seems reasonable, but I was hoping to explore some flexibility in the pricing as our budget is a bit tight. We might have around 150 guests, and it would be great to know if you could offer any discounts for this number. Also, can you clarify if VAT is included in the $75 price?  

We are particularly interested in a mixed menu and would need vegetarian options as well. Could you provide a few examples of the dishes you would serve?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. For 150 guests, I can offer a discounted rate of $70 per person, and I can confirm that this price includes VAT. As for the menu, we can provide a variety of dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, stuffed portobello mushrooms, and assorted desserts.  

We can certainly accommodate vegetarian preferences, and if you like, we can include beverages for an additional $15 per person. Please let me know if this aligns better with your budget, and we can finalize the details.

Hi Matthew,  

Thank you for the revised offer. The $70 per person rate works well for us, and I appreciate that it includes VAT. I’d like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests, including the vegetarian options. Please confirm that the meal will be kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision as we discussed.  

I also want to clarify the cancellation policy before we finalize everything. If we decide to cancel within a week of the event, what would be the implications?  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can move ahead.  

Best regards,
