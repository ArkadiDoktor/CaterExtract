Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Conference  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming conference on November 15th. We would be thrilled to provide our services for this event.  

We typically offer a mixed menu option, which can include delicious meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $45 per person, and this includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and we are more than happy to discuss any dietary requirements you might have.  

Additionally, I wanted to mention that all our food is kosher, supervised under the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a selection of beverages, although a full bar would be an additional charge.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu options further or require any additional information.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm a few details before moving forward. Can you provide more information on the menu items included in the $45 per person rate? We are looking for a mix of vegetarian and meat options that can cater to various dietary needs.  

Also, I’d appreciate it if you could clarify the cancellation policy, as we want to ensure our options are flexible in case of any changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. For the $45 per person rate, we typically include items like grilled chicken, a seasonal vegetable medley, assorted salads, and a couple of vegetarian pasta options. We can also accommodate gluten-free and nut-free requests upon advance notice.  

Regarding cancellation, we allow changes or cancellations up to 14 days before the event without penalty. After that, a 50% charge of the total estimated cost would apply.  

If this sounds good, I can prepare a detailed menu for your approval.  

Best,
