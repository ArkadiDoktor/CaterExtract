Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the pricing. The £45 per person seems reasonable for our budget. I would appreciate a sample menu to review, especially any highlights you think would be best suited for the occasion.  

Also, could you confirm if the food is kosher? Our attendees would prefer kosher options, ideally under supervision. Additionally, we are considering whether to include a bar service. Is that something you provide, or would that be separate?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear that the pricing is within your budget. I will send over a sample menu shortly, featuring some of our most popular dishes, including herb-marinated chicken and roasted vegetable lasagna.  

Regarding your questions, all our food is kosher and is certified by the London Beth Din. We can provide bar service, but it will be an additional cost of £15 per person. If you decide to include that, please let me know the expected number of guests so I can provide an accurate quote.  

In terms of setup, we will handle all the necessary equipment and staffing for the event. If you confirm the number of attendees, I can finalize the total cost for you.

Thank you for the clarification on the kosher certification and the bar service details. After discussing with my team, we’ve decided to move forward with the catering. We will have 150 guests, which brings the total to £9,000, including the bar service. Please confirm that this includes VAT.  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to receiving the sample menu. Let’s finalize everything soon, as we are excited about the event.
