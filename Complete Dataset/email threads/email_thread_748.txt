Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, but I wanted to clarify a few details. We expect around 75 guests, and I wanted to know if you can lower the price to $40 per person. Additionally, can you confirm if the food is kosher and under what supervision? Lastly, are beverages included in your proposal?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your response. We can accommodate the price of $40 per person for 75 guests, bringing the total to $3,000. I can confirm that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can include a selection of non-alcoholic beverages in that price. However, for alcoholic drinks, we would need to discuss a separate arrangement.  

Please let me know if this meets your needs, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
