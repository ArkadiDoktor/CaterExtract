Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding your event on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your corporate gala.  

We offer a diverse menu that includes both meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing structure is typically set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

Additionally, we provide a selection of beverages with our catering packages, but please let us know if you would like to arrange a full bar service, as that would incur additional costs. We can also cater to various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

I would be happy to provide a sample menu for your review. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the details on your catering services. The menu sounds great, but I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would you be open to negotiating the per person price? We are expecting around 100 guests, so a slight adjustment could really help us move forward.  

Also, could you specify the cancellation terms? I want to ensure we have that covered in case of any changes.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the pricing. For a group of 100 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person, which would bring the total to $4,000, including VAT. As for the cancellation terms, we typically require at least 14 days' notice for a full refund.  

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, and I can send over the menu options for your review.
