Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on April 15th. We specialize in providing a variety of menu options that can accommodate different dietary preferences. Our standard pricing is set at $50 per person, which includes a selection of dishes that cater to both meat and dairy options. We can handle events with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200.  

All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet the highest standards. We can also provide beverages, including soft drinks and coffee, as part of the package. VAT will be included in the final invoice.  

If you would like, I can send over a sample menu featuring some of our most popular items, such as herb-roasted chicken, quinoa salad, and assorted pastries. Please let me know if you have any specific requests or dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. I appreciate your quick response. The menu sounds great, especially the herb-roasted chicken. However, our guest count might fluctuate a bit, possibly going as low as 40 or as high as 220. Would you be flexible with that range?  

Also, can you confirm if there are any additional costs for dietary accommodations, like gluten-free options? I’m particularly interested in ensuring we can cater to those needs as well.  

Lastly, could you clarify your cancellation policy?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can accommodate a range of 40 to 220 guests without any issues. For gluten-free options, there would be an additional cost of $5 per person, but we can certainly include those in your final count.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 10 days prior to the event date for full refunds. If cancellation occurs within 10 days, we can offer a 50% refund.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the proposal, and I can send you a formal agreement.

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I’d like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests, which would bring the total to $7,500, including VAT. Please prepare the formal agreement, and let’s ensure we include the gluten-free options as discussed.  

I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to a successful event.
