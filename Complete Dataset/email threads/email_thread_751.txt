Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price per person a bit. Is there any flexibility to lower it to $70, especially considering we might have around 120 guests?  

Also, could you clarify whether the $75 price includes VAT? We want to ensure we have a complete understanding of the costs involved.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your willingness to discuss the details. We can indeed adjust the price to $70 per person for 120 guests, bringing the total to $8,400. This price does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

Regarding the menu, we can offer a selection of grilled chicken, beef brisket, and vegetarian options, along with salads and desserts. We can also accommodate specific dietary restrictions if you provide those details. Please let me know if this arrangement works for you.
