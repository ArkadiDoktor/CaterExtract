Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide a menu that suits your needs. Our offerings include a selection of gourmet dishes, and we can accommodate a wide range of dietary requirements.

For a fixed price of $75 per person, we can serve a mixed menu with options such as herb-crusted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and seasonal salads. This pricing is based on a minimum of 50 guests and can be adjusted for up to 150 guests. We ensure that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, so you can feel confident in the quality and compliance of our offerings.

Please note that our pricing includes VAT, but beverages and bar services would be an additional charge. If you have any specific requests or preferences, do not hesitate to let us know.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed information. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, our guest list is expected to be around 120 people. Would you be able to accommodate that without changing the price? Additionally, could you clarify what beverage options you provide, as we might want to include a bar service.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear that the menu appeals to you. We can certainly accommodate 120 guests at the same price of $75 per person. Regarding beverages, we offer a full bar service starting at $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. If you prefer, we can also provide a non-alcoholic beverage package for $10 per person.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement. The cancellation policy is flexible, allowing you to cancel up to one week prior to the event with a full refund.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the guest count and for providing the details on the beverage options. I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests at $75 per person, and I would appreciate the full bar service for an additional $20 per person. This brings the total to $9,000. Please confirm that this includes VAT.  

I look forward to finalizing this arrangement.
