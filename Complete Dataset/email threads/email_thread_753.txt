Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming conference on November 15. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Our services can accommodate a range of dietary preferences, including kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, we typically charge $50 per person. We can serve between 100 and 200 guests, and this price includes VAT. However, please note that beverages are not included in this pricing.  

We can offer a selection of appetizers such as mini beef sliders, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of salads. For the main course, options include chicken francaise and a vegetarian pasta primavera. Would you like to schedule a time to discuss this in more detail?  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds delicious, but we are actually expecting around 150 guests. Could you confirm if the pricing remains the same at that number? Additionally, while I appreciate the selection, can you offer any other dishes or alternatives for dietary restrictions, particularly for gluten-free and vegan options?  

Also, could you clarify your cancellation policy? It's crucial for us to understand our options should our plans change.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The price will indeed remain at $50 per person for 150 guests. Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide gluten-free and vegan options, such as quinoa salad and roasted vegetable tacos.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for full refunds. The final price for 150 guests would be $7,500, including VAT.  

If everything looks good to you, I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,
