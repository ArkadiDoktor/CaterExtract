Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on March 15th at the Grand Hall. I am excited to assist you in making this event memorable. We specialize in a range of menu options and can accommodate various dietary needs. Our kosher meals are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet the highest standards.  

For your event, we offer a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of vegetarian dishes. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Please note that our pricing does not include VAT, which is an additional 15%.  

We also provide beverage services separately, including a full bar if desired. Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific preferences.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points. Would you be able to offer any flexibility on the per-person price if we can confirm attendance closer to the minimum guest count? Also, could you provide more details on the cancellation policy?  

We are still finalizing the guest list, so I would appreciate any options you can offer.  

Best,  
Samantha

Hi Samantha,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can adjust the price to $70 per person if you confirm a minimum of 75 guests, which could make it more manageable for your budget. As for the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to 30 days before the event with a full refund. For cancellations made within 30 days, we retain a 25% deposit.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any other questions.  

Warm regards,
