Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed menu options. I appreciate the inclusion of VAT in your pricing. However, I would like to confirm if the food will be kosher, as we have guests who adhere to dietary restrictions. Additionally, can you clarify if beverages are included in the $75 price?  

I anticipate around 100 guests for the gala, and I am particularly interested in having some kosher options available. Could you provide more details on the supervision of the kosher meals?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that we can provide a kosher menu that is supervised by the Orthodox Union. The $75 per person includes a selection of hors d'oeuvres, an entrée, and dessert, but beverages are not included in that price. We can arrange for a bar service if you're interested, and I would be happy to discuss the options with you.  

If you would like to go ahead with the 100 guests, I can finalize the menu and send over a formal agreement. Our cancellation policy allows for changes up to a week before the event without penalty.  

I look forward to your decision.  

Best,
