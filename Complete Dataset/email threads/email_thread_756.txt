Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your upcoming gala scheduled for May 15th at the Grand Hall. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion.  

Our menu features a diverse selection of dishes, including grilled chicken with seasonal vegetables, a gourmet pasta station, and a lavish dessert bar. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests, with a pricing structure of $45 per person. This price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can ensure that the food is kosher, under the supervision of the Beth Din of America. While our focus will be on the food, we can also provide non-alcoholic beverages if required.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific dietary needs we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate your attention to kosher requirements. However, I would like to know if you can adjust the pricing slightly, as we are exploring options that fit our budget better. Would you be open to discussing a lower rate?  

Also, could you clarify if you provide any staffing for setup and service during the event? We are expecting around 150 guests, but we want to ensure everything runs smoothly.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your response. I understand the need to stay within budget, and I can offer a revised rate of $40 per person for your event. This still includes VAT and all the menu items we discussed.  

As for staffing, we do provide professional servers at an additional cost, which can ensure a seamless experience for your guests. If you decide to go with us, we can also assist with the setup.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I would be happy to finalize the details.
