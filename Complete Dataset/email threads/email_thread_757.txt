Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15 at the Grand Ballroom. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs, and I believe we can create a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

Typically, our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which allows for flexibility depending on the final guest count. For a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, our rates start at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. We can also accommodate kosher dietary requirements under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know your expected number of guests so we can finalize the details, including whether you'd like beverages included, as they are typically offered separately. We also have options for staffing and event setup.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. We are expecting between 150 and 200 guests for the event. I appreciate your flexibility with dietary accommodations, as we will need to ensure we cater to various preferences, including vegan options.  

Could you confirm if the $50 per person rate includes VAT? Additionally, we would prefer to have a full bar included in the package if possible. I understand that this may adjust the pricing.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. The $50 per person rate does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. If you'd like to include a full bar, we can adjust the total to $75 per person, which would cover a selection of wines, spirits, and cocktails.  

Regarding the guest count, we can comfortably cater for up to 250 attendees. For the menu, I suggest featuring dishes like herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a gourmet dessert platter. We can certainly accommodate vegan options as well.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal proposal.  

Best,
