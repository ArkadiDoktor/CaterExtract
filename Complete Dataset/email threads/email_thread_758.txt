Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the catering options for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th at the Riverside Convention Center. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to events like yours.  

For an event of this nature, we offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. This price does not include VAT, which will be added on top.  

We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests and are happy to discuss any specific dietary requirements you may have. Additionally, we can provide staff for setup and service, ensuring everything runs smoothly during the event.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, we have a budget to consider. Would you be open to negotiating the price if we confirm the number of guests closer to the date?  

Also, could you clarify if the $75 per person covers beverages or if those are excluded? It would be helpful to know more about the specific dishes included in the menu as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to stay within budget. For a confirmed guest count of 150 or more, I can adjust the price to $70 per person, which still includes a diverse selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts, along with standard beverages. However, premium bar options would be additional.  

In terms of menu highlights, we can offer dishes like herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a decadent chocolate mousse for dessert. Please let me know if you would like to finalize the arrangements or if you have any further questions about dietary accommodations.  

Best regards,

I would like to confirm the catering for 150 guests at the adjusted price of $70 per person, which will bring the total to $10,500, excluding VAT. Please include standard beverages, and I will get back to you shortly regarding any specific dietary needs.  

As for the cancellation policy, could you please send that over? I look forward to working together to make this event a success.
