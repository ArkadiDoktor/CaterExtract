Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the details provided. The menu sounds appealing, but I was hoping to explore a few adjustments. Given the nature of the event, we might require a more extensive range of appetizers and perhaps some additional beverage options.  

Could you offer a slightly revised price if we increase the guest count to 150? Also, how does the cancellation policy work in case we need to make changes closer to the date?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your thoughts and the interest in expanding the menu. If we adjust the guest count to 150, the price per person can remain at $45, making the total $6,750. This includes a more varied selection of appetizers, but please note that beverages would be an additional cost.  

Regarding cancellations, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks before the event for a full refund. We can discuss specific menu items to ensure they align with your expectations.  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!  

Warm regards,
