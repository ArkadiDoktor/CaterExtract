Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding the catering for your wedding reception on May 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would love to help make your event special.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences. Our pricing starts at twenty-five dollars per person, which includes delicious appetizers, a main course, and desserts. We can cater to a minimum of fifty guests, and we can comfortably serve up to two hundred guests. All prices are inclusive of VAT, and we can also provide kosher options supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you'd like to see a sample menu or have specific dishes in mind. I look forward to your response.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a few details. We are expecting around a hundred guests, and I would appreciate if you could provide a more detailed breakdown of the menu, particularly regarding the kosher options.  

Additionally, could you let me know if beverages, including a bar service, are included in that price? Finally, what are your cancellation terms?  

Thanks for your help!  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. For a hundred guests, the total would come to two thousand five hundred dollars, which includes a selection of hors d'oeuvres, your choice of two main courses, and a dessert display. Our kosher options feature dishes like herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetables, all under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Beverages are not included in the initial pricing but can be added at an additional cost. We offer a full bar service if you are interested. Regarding cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over the detailed menu options.  

Best,  
Michael
