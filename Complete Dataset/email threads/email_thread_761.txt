Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to offer our catering services for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food options and can cater to a wide variety of dietary preferences. Our menu typically features a selection of meat and dairy dishes, and we are happy to discuss specific items that would best suit your guests.  

For events of this nature, we generally charge $45 per person, which includes setup and service staff. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests, and we can cater for up to 150. Please let me know if you have a specific guest count in mind, and I will be glad to prepare a detailed proposal.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are indeed expecting around 100 guests, and I appreciate the pricing information you provided. Could you please clarify if the $45 per person includes VAT? Additionally, it would be helpful to know if you offer any kosher options and what supervision is in place. We are also considering whether to include a bar service or if that would be an additional cost.  

I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person does include VAT, so there won't be any additional charges there. We do offer kosher options, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and our menu can certainly accommodate such preferences. As for beverages, we can provide a bar service for an additional $15 per person, or we can offer a selection of non-alcoholic drinks included in the main price.  

Please let me know if this works for your event, and I can send over a proposed menu featuring some highlights.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification regarding the pricing and kosher supervision. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at $45 per person, including VAT and a selection of non-alcoholic drinks. Let's finalize the menu soon, but I would like to ensure we have options for those with dietary restrictions as well. Additionally, please send over your cancellation policy when you have a moment.  

Looking forward to working together.  

Best,
