Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming wedding on October 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making this event memorable.  

Our typical menu for weddings includes a variety of options, and we specialize in kosher cuisine, supervised by the Orthodox Union. We can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, ensuring that all dietary restrictions are accommodated.  

For our services, we generally charge $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing for the event. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and we recommend that you confirm your final guest count at least a week before the event. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

As for beverages, we offer a separate bar package, which can be customized based on your preferences. We have a selection of wines and spirits available, along with non-alcoholic options.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific menu items in mind.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate your flexibility with the menu options. Since we are expecting between 120 and 130 guests, can you accommodate that number comfortably?  

I would like to clarify a couple of points. Is it possible to include a few more vegetarian options in the menu? Additionally, could you provide a specific list of dishes that you would recommend?  

Lastly, I noticed the price per person. Is there any room for negotiation if we confirm the guest count soon?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can certainly accommodate 120 to 130 guests without any issues. I understand the need for more vegetarian options, and I can include a few dishes such as roasted vegetable lasagna and quinoa salad alongside our standard offerings.  

Regarding the pricing, I can offer a slight discount to $70 per person if you confirm the guest count by the end of this week. Our typical dishes for the mixed menu would include chicken marsala, brisket with root vegetables, and a selection of seasonal sides.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I will send over a final proposal for your review.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your willingness to adjust the menu and pricing. I appreciate the inclusion of more vegetarian options and the discount offer. I would like to proceed with your proposal at $70 per person for 130 guests.  

This will include the mixed menu featuring the suggested dishes, with the understanding that it is kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision. Please ensure that the setup is ready by 4 PM on the day of the event, as the ceremony will begin at 5 PM.  

Let’s finalize everything and make sure we have a fantastic celebration.  

Best,
