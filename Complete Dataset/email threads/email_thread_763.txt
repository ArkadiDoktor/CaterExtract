Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds appealing, but I would like to clarify a few things. We are expecting around 150 guests, and I want to ensure that the price per person remains fixed at $45, including VAT. Additionally, can you confirm if you offer any vegan or gluten-free options?  

Also, I noticed that the beverage service is separate. Could you provide more details on the options available and their pricing? Lastly, what are your cancellation terms in case our guest count changes significantly?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions regarding the menu and pricing. I can confirm that the price will remain fixed at $45 per person for 150 guests, and we can offer both vegan and gluten-free options to accommodate dietary restrictions. As for the beverages, we have a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks that can be provided for an additional cost of $10 per person.  

Regarding cancellation terms, you can cancel up to two weeks before the event without any penalties. After that point, a 50% cancellation fee will apply. If you decide to move forward, I can prepare a detailed contract for your review.
