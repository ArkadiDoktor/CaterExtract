Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Green, and I represent Tasteful Events Catering. I understand you are organizing a conference on December 15th at the Grand Hotel, and I would love to assist you with your catering needs.  

We specialize in providing a range of menu options that can cater to various dietary preferences, including kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing typically ranges from 30 to 50 dollars per person, depending on the menu selection. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests and can provide both meat and dairy options. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requirements in mind.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The conference will indeed require catering for about 150 attendees, and I appreciate the flexibility in your menu options. However, I would like to clarify whether the pricing you mentioned is inclusive of VAT, as we have a strict budget.  

Additionally, could you confirm if the bar service is included? We are considering providing a selection of beverages, but I want to ensure that aligns with your offerings.  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your questions. The prices I provided do not include VAT, which would be added on top of the final price. As for the bar service, we can offer a package that includes a selection of drinks for an additional 15 dollars per person.  

If you’re looking for a full menu, I recommend our grilled chicken with roasted vegetables and a vegetarian pasta option. We can also accommodate gluten-free and vegan requests upon prior notice. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement, and I will prepare a detailed proposal.  

Best wishes,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed information. I believe we can work with your proposal. Please confirm that the total cost for 150 guests will be 7,500 dollars, including the bar service and excluding VAT. I would also like to clarify the cancellation policy, just to ensure everything is in place.  

Once I have that information, I will be happy to finalize everything.
