Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on June 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary needs while ensuring a delightful culinary experience for all guests.  

For this event, our pricing structure is set at a fixed price of $75 per person. This includes a selection of hors d'oeuvres, a main course, and dessert, along with staff for setup and service. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note, the quoted price includes VAT.  

If you are interested, I can provide a sample menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options. We also offer kosher catering under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, should that be a requirement for your guests.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for detailing the pricing. I appreciate the flexibility in accommodating dietary needs. However, I would like to clarify a couple of points before moving forward.  

Could you provide more information about the specific menu items included in the price? We are also considering whether to include a bar service for the evening; what would the additional cost be if we chose to add that? Additionally, we are expecting around 120 guests, but we would like to know if there is any flexibility on the pricing if we exceed that number.  

Finally, could you please confirm your cancellation policy?  

Thank you in advance for your assistance.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up questions. I can certainly provide you with a sample menu, which typically includes options like herb-crusted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. For dessert, we often feature a chocolate mousse or fruit tart.  

Regarding the bar service, we can offer a full bar package for an additional $30 per person, which includes a variety of wines, beers, and cocktails. If you anticipate exceeding 120 guests, we can maintain the same price per person up to 150 guests, ensuring your costs do not increase.  

Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to 30 days prior to the event, with a 50% refund for cancellations made up to a week before.  

Please let me know if this meets your needs, and I would be happy to finalize the arrangements.  

Warm regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for the detailed information. I would like to proceed with the catering arrangement for 120 guests, including the bar service. This brings the total to $12,000, which I understand includes VAT. Please confirm that this price is fixed and all details, including the kosher supervision, are as discussed.  

Once I receive your confirmation, I will send over the deposit to secure our booking.  

Best regards,  
Sarah Johnson
