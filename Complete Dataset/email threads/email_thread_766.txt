Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our team specializes in a mixed menu, which includes a variety of meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone.  

For events like yours, we typically operate on a pricing structure of $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that our prices do not include VAT, which will be added on top of the quoted amount.  

Additionally, we offer kosher food under the supervision of the local rabbi, ensuring it meets the necessary standards. I can also confirm that we can provide a bar service if desired, though it is not included in the base price.  

I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal and any specific dietary requirements you might have.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I’d like to discuss the possibility of adjusting the per-person cost. We are expecting closer to 100 guests, and I was hoping we could negotiate a fixed price for the total, possibly closer to $7,000. I also want to confirm if you can accommodate any vegetarian and gluten-free options as some of our guests have dietary restrictions.  

Could you also let me know about the cancellation terms? It’s crucial for us to understand that aspect as we finalize our decisions.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns. We can adjust the pricing to a fixed total of $7,500 for 100 guests, which will include a variety of dietary options, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.  

Regarding cancellation, our policy requires a notice of 30 days prior to the event for a full refund. Any cancellations made closer to the date will incur a fee of 50% of the total cost.  

Please let me know if that works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.
