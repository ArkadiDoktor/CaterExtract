Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you're organizing a corporate gala on December 15th and are looking for catering services. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events like yours.  

Our menu is diverse, offering options that include meat, dairy, and vegetarian dishes. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. Pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT and a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We also ensure that all meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

If you're interested, I would be happy to send you a sample menu and discuss any dietary needs your guests may have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing, especially the kosher options. However, we might have a few more guests than the minimum you mentioned, potentially reaching around 150. Could you confirm if the pricing remains the same for that number and if beverages are included in your package?  

Also, could you provide details about cancellation terms? This will help us finalize our plans.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your inquiry. For 150 guests, the pricing would adjust slightly to $42 per person, still including VAT. Unfortunately, beverages are not included in that price, but we can offer a bar package starting at an additional $15 per person.  

Regarding cancellation, we maintain a policy that allows for full refunds up to 14 days before the event. After that, we would retain a 25% deposit.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a finalized menu that includes highlights of our offerings.  

Best,
