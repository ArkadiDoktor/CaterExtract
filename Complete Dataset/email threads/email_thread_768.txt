Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Alex Cohen, and I am the catering manager at Gourmet Delights. I understand you are planning a large corporate gala on May 15th, and I would love the opportunity to cater for your event.  

We specialize in providing high-quality meals for various events, and our menu includes a range of options that can accommodate different dietary needs. We can prepare a delicious mixed menu, including both meat and vegetarian dishes, all under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing typically runs around $50 per person, and we can cater for a minimum of 100 guests, with a maximum of 250. This price includes all necessary setup and staffing, while beverages would be an additional charge. I can provide you with a sample menu if you're interested.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further.  

Best regards,  
Alex Cohen

Hi Alex,  

Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the details you provided about your catering services. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I am glad to hear about the kosher supervision. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of points.  

Is the $50 per person price inclusive of VAT? Also, while we are expecting around 150 guests, I would like to know if you can offer any flexibility on the pricing if we finalize a larger number. Additionally, could you confirm if the beverages are exclusively excluded, or do you have any packages that might include them?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt response. To clarify, the $50 per person does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. If you decide to increase the guest count to 200, we can reduce the price to $45 per person.  

Regarding beverages, we can offer a beverage package for an additional $15 per person, which includes wine, beer, and non-alcoholic options. Let me know if this works for you, and I can draft a more detailed proposal.  

Best,

Hi Alex,  

Thank you for the revised pricing and the information on the beverage package. I would like to proceed with the catering for 200 guests at $45 per person plus VAT, including the beverage package. This brings the total to $12,000. Please send over the contract and any details about the cancellation policy.  

Looking forward to finalizing this!
