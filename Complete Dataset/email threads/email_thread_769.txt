Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding reception on April 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to provide catering services for this special occasion. We specialize in creating vibrant, memorable food experiences, and I believe we can craft a menu that your guests will love.  

For events like yours, we typically offer a mixed menu which includes a variety of meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let us know if any guests require special meals.  

Our pricing is generally structured at $75 per person, which includes a full meal service, setup, and staffing. This price also covers a standard selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Should you have between 100 and 150 guests, we can finalize the specifics once we receive your guest count. Please note that VAT will be added on top of the quoted price.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requirements in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds promising, and I appreciate the detail you provided. However, I am hoping to keep costs a bit lower. Would you be willing to adjust the price to $65 per person? Additionally, we expect around 120 guests, and I would like to confirm that beverages will be provided as part of the package.  

Could you also clarify whether the VAT will be included in the total or added later?  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest and understand the need to manage costs effectively. I can offer you a revised price of $70 per person for 120 guests, which still provides a comprehensive menu of our best selections. We can include a bar with a limited drink offering, but please note that the full beverage package is an additional cost.  

VAT will be added on top of the total amount, as is standard practice. If you confirm this arrangement, the total would come to $8,400, which is inclusive of setup and service for the event.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
