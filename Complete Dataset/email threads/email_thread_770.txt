Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be thrilled to provide catering services for your event.  

We offer a diverse menu featuring a selection of meat and dairy options, ensuring that there is something for everyone. Our pricing is structured at £45 per person, and for your expected attendance of between 50 to 100 guests, this would provide a comprehensive dining experience.  

Included in our services are setup and staffing, and all our food is kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian options. Please note that beverages and a bar service are not included in the initial pricing but can be arranged separately.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. I appreciate the menu options and kosher supervision, as that’s essential for our guests. However, I am wondering if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, particularly if we settle for around 70 guests. I would like to confirm whether VAT is included in the quoted price.  

Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy? It's important for us to know our options in case of any unforeseen changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can offer a revised price of £42 per person for a group of 70 guests, and I can confirm that VAT is included in this rate.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we offer a full refund if canceled at least 14 days prior to the event. After that, a fee of 50% of the total will apply.  

I hope this works for you. Please let me know if there are any other adjustments needed.  

Best,
