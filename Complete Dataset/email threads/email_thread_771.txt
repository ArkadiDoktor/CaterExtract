Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing catering services for events like yours and would love to help make your evening memorable. 

Our menu options include a variety of dishes that can accommodate different dietary needs, including kosher selections. We can offer a mixed menu of meat and dairy options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. For your event, I recommend our signature dishes such as herb-crusted salmon and a gourmet vegan pasta. 

In terms of pricing, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. This rate also covers a minimum of 50 guests and can be adjusted for a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that VAT is included in this pricing.

I look forward to your response so we can discuss this further.

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided about the menu and pricing. However, I would like to clarify a few points. We are expecting about 100 guests, but we might need to increase that number depending on RSVPs.

Could you confirm if the price you mentioned includes beverages? Additionally, could you accommodate gluten-free options for a few of our guests? Finally, what are your cancellation terms in case we need to make changes down the line?

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your questions. Our pricing of $75 per person does not include beverages; however, we can offer a beverage package at an additional cost. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free options as well, ensuring that all dietary needs are met.

Regarding cancellation, we ask for a two-week notice for any changes or cancellations, after which a fee may apply. If you decide to go ahead with the booking for 100 guests, I can reserve the date for you.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Best,
