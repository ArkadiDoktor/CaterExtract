Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Based on your estimated guest count of 100 to 150 attendees, we can offer a mixed menu featuring options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of seasonal salads. 

Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes all necessary set-up and staffing. Please note that this price includes VAT, so there are no hidden costs. Additionally, we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian options. 

If you choose to include a bar, we can discuss additional costs. We follow strict kosher guidelines under supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary needs are met. 

Let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any further questions.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds promising, but I was wondering if you could offer a slight discount for an estimated guest count of 120. Also, can you clarify if the $45 per person includes beverages or if that would be an additional cost? 

Lastly, we are looking for a cancellation policy in case the event needs to be rescheduled.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding pricing. For a count of 120 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $42 per person. The price does not include beverages, but we can provide a bar package starting at an additional $15 per person. 

For the cancellation policy, we typically allow for a full refund up to two weeks before the event date. After that, a 50% cancellation fee would apply. 

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.
