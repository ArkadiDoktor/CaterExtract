Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. Our menu offers a variety of options, including mixed dishes that cater to a range of dietary needs. For this event, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes all food items and service.

We can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests, and our offerings can be tailored to suit dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. I would also like to inform you that our food is kosher, supervised by the local Kashrut authority.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu further or have any specific requests. We look forward to the possibility of working together.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The price point is reasonable, but I was hoping to see if there is any flexibility in your pricing structure, especially considering we may have closer to 150 guests. Also, could you clarify if the $75 includes VAT, and what the cancellation terms would look like?

Additionally, do you offer a bar service, or would that be a separate arrangement? We want to ensure that our guests have a complete experience.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your follow-up. The pricing of $75 per person does indeed include VAT, so there won’t be any surprises there. Regarding the cancellation policy, we can offer a full refund if cancelled at least two weeks prior to the event; otherwise, we retain a 25% deposit.

As for the bar service, we don’t include it in our standard package, but we can coordinate with a local bar service to create a customized beverage package for your event. If you would like to proceed with the catering, I can finalize a menu that highlights some of our best dishes, including braised beef and a seasonal vegetable risotto.

Please let me know if this sounds good, and we can move forward.

Warm regards,
