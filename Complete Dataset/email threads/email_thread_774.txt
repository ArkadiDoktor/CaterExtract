Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming gala dinner on June 15. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to discuss how we can meet your needs. 

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a selection of meat and dairy options to accommodate various preferences. Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staff for the evening. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests, and our prices include VAT. 

Additionally, our meals are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet kosher standards. We also offer a range of dietary accommodations, such as gluten-free and vegetarian options. Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu in more detail.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your prompt response and detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision information. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Given our budget constraints, would you be open to discussing a price closer to $65 per person? 

Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are included in that price? It would be helpful to know if we need to arrange a bar separately.

Thanks again for your assistance. I look forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your feedback. I can appreciate the need to stay within your budget. While I am unable to go down to $65 per person, I can offer you a revised price of $70 per person. This still includes the full menu, setup, and staff. 

Regarding beverages, our current proposal does not include a bar service. However, we can arrange a beverage package that includes soft drinks and wine for an additional cost. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can provide more details on the drink options.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Hi Mark,

Thank you for adjusting the price and clarifying the beverage situation. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to accept your revised offer of $70 per person for 100 guests, which brings the total to $7,000. I understand that this price is inclusive of VAT but does not include the bar service. 

Please send over the contract and any additional details regarding the setup and staff. I also want to confirm the cancellation policy before we finalize everything. 

Thanks for all your help. I look forward to moving ahead with this!

Best,
