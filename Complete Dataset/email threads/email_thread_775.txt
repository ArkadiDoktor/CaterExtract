Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming wedding reception on April 15th. We specialize in creating memorable culinary experiences, and I would love to discuss how we can cater your event.  

For a celebration like yours, we offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring a delightful variety for all your guests. Our pricing is structured at $90 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and decadent desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and we do include VAT in our pricing.  

Additionally, we offer kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council, and I can provide a detailed menu tailored to your preferences. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to include beverages or a bar service.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds wonderful, but we are looking at a slightly tighter budget. Is there any flexibility on the per-person price? Also, could you clarify if the menu can include vegetarian options for some of our guests?  

We would also like to know if a bar service is available as an add-on, and what the cancellation terms would be in case our plans change.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need for budget considerations. I can reduce the price to $85 per person if we simplify the menu slightly while maintaining a great selection. We can definitely include vegetarian options as part of the offerings.  

As for the bar service, that would be an additional cost of $15 per person, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if notified at least two weeks prior to the event. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your revised proposal. I think we can work with the $85 per person price, and I appreciate your inclusion of vegetarian options. We would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests, which brings the total to $10,200. Please confirm that this includes VAT and that kosher supervision is provided.  

Once we finalize everything, I will send over the contract for your review.  

Best regards,
