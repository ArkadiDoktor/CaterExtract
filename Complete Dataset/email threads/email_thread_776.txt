Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I’m reaching out from Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15, and I would love to provide you with a catering proposal.  

We specialize in a range of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu that includes vegetarian, meat, and pareve options. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can comfortably cater to a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.

Hi David,  

Thank you for reaching out. The gala is shaping up nicely, and I appreciate your prompt proposal. I’d like to confirm if your catering is kosher and under what supervision, as it is important for our guests. Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in the $75 per person price or if they are separate?  

If possible, I’d love to explore a few more options for the menu. I want to ensure we can accommodate various dietary needs, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can confirm that our menu is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards. The $75 per person price includes the meal but excludes beverages, which we can provide for an additional $15 per person if that works for you.  

Regarding the menu, I can offer a selection of dishes including grilled salmon, stuffed peppers, and a variety of salads. We also can accommodate gluten-free and vegan diets upon request.  

If you have a specific number of guests in mind, please share, and I can provide a more tailored proposal.  

Best,
