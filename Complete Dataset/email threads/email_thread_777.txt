Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on June 15, and I would love to discuss how we can cater for your event. We offer a variety of menus, including mixed cuisine options, and can provide dietary accommodations to suit your guests’ needs.  

Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We also ensure that all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the local rabbi, if that is a requirement for your event.  

I would be happy to provide you with a sample menu and discuss any specific requests you might have. Please let me know how many guests you are expecting, as we can cater to a minimum of 50 up to 200 guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are indeed looking at around 150 guests for the gala. I appreciate that you offer kosher options; however, could you clarify whether the $50 per person includes VAT? Also, I wanted to inquire if beverages are included in that price or if they would be an additional charge.  

Additionally, we would like a sample menu that reflects a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes, as some of our guests have specific dietary restrictions.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of $50 per person does not include VAT, which would be added on top. Regarding beverages, we typically offer a bar service as an optional addition to the catering package. I can provide a full breakdown if you're interested in including that.  

I will send over a sample menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options shortly. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let me know if there are any specific needs.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details with you.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. After reviewing everything, I would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests at the price of $50 per person plus VAT. Please also include the bar service. I appreciate your flexibility with dietary options as well.  

Could you please confirm the total cost, including VAT, and the cancellation policy? Once I have that, I can finalize everything on my end.  

Thank you for your help!  

Best regards,
