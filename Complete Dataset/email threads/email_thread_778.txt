Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel Rosen from Gourmet Delights Catering. I am excited to hear about the upcoming wedding you are organizing on June 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We specialize in creating memorable culinary experiences and would be thrilled to cater for your event. 

Our pricing structure is flexible and typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the menu selections. We offer a mixed menu that includes options for meat and dairy, ensuring there’s something for everyone. If you require kosher options, we can provide dishes under the supervision of the Kof-K organization. 

In addition, we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegan upon request. Please let me know the estimated number of guests, as our minimum is 100 and maximum is 300. I look forward to discussing this further and tailoring a menu that fits your vision.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Rosen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information regarding your catering services. The wedding will indeed have around 150 guests, and I appreciate the range you've provided. I’m particularly interested in the kosher options, as many of our guests adhere to dietary laws. Could you confirm whether the $75 per person price includes VAT? Also, while we are planning to have a bar, I would like to know if beverages are included in your package or if they are priced separately.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Samantha,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person pricing does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final total. Regarding beverages, we can provide a selection of wines and soft drinks for an additional charge, or you can opt to manage your own bar if you prefer. 

If you decide to go with the full package including kosher meals, we could finalize the menu with items like herb-roasted chicken, vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads. Let me know if you have any specific preferences or additional requests.  

Best,

We will include kosher meals supervised by Kof-K and will manage our own bar. Please provide a contract outlining the cancellation policy and any additional notes regarding setup and staffing.  

Looking forward to finalizing this agreement.
