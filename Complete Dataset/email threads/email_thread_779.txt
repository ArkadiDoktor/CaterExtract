Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a few things. Our expected attendance could be between 70 to 120 guests, so I’d like to know how this might affect the cost.  

Also, can you confirm if the food will be kosher? We are looking for kosher supervision, particularly for meat dishes. Lastly, we are considering including beverages; could you provide pricing for that as well?  

Thank you!  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. If we proceed with 100 guests, the total would come to $6,000, plus VAT, which would be approximately $720. As for the kosher aspect, we can provide a kosher menu under the supervision of the local rabbinical council, ensuring all dietary requirements are met.  

Regarding the bar, we can offer a selection of wines and cocktails for an additional $25 per person. I believe this would enhance the overall experience. Please let me know your thoughts on these adjustments.  

Best,
