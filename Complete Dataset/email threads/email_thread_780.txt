Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming conference on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. We specialize in providing high-quality meals and can offer a diverse menu that can accommodate a range of dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is simple, with a cost of $45 per person, which includes VAT.  

We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150. Our standard menu features a mix of meat and dairy options, and we can also provide vegetarian and gluten-free dishes upon request. Additionally, all our meals are kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages or a bar service, as these are typically charged separately.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the proposal. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher certification details. However, our guest count is a bit uncertain at the moment, as we might have between 60 to 120 attendees. Would you be able to accommodate that range? Also, could you provide a few examples of menu items?  

Additionally, we are considering including a drink package. Could you clarify the pricing for that? Lastly, could you outline your cancellation policy in case we need to adjust our plans?  

Thanks for your help.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I can certainly accommodate a guest count between 60 and 120. For the menu, I would suggest options like herb-roasted chicken, stuffed bell peppers, and a selection of seasonal salads. As for beverages, we typically offer a drink package starting at $15 per person, which includes soft drinks and a selection of wines.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days before the event for a full refund. If cancellations occur within two weeks, we can offer a 50% refund. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement.
