Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events like yours.  

For your gala, we can offer a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed rate of 50 dollars per person, and this includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250 guests.  

Additionally, all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union, ensuring that it meets all dietary needs. We can also provide a selection of beverages, including soft drinks and mineral water, but please note that a full bar is not included in this package.  

If you have any specific dietary accommodations in mind, please let us know, and we can discuss how best to meet those needs.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, but I was wondering if there is any flexibility in the pricing if we end up having more than 200 guests. Also, can you confirm if the beverages will include any alcoholic options, or should we consider hiring a bar service separately?  

We are expecting around 180 guests currently, but we want to be prepared in case we exceed that number.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can certainly adjust the pricing to 48 dollars per person for any guests beyond the initial 200, should you exceed that number. Unfortunately, our package does not include alcoholic beverages, so you would need to arrange a separate bar service if that is something you wish to include.  

Please let me know if you would like to move forward, and I can provide a formal quote for the expected number of guests.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your clarification. I would like to proceed with your catering services for 180 guests at the agreed rate of 50 dollars per person, which totals to 9,000 dollars. I appreciate your flexibility on the pricing. Please confirm that the food will be kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision and that we can provide dietary accommodations as needed.  

Could you also confirm the cancellation policy? I look forward to your swift reply so we can finalize the arrangements.  

Best regards,
