Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights Catering. We would be thrilled to provide our services for your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in mixed menus and can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For your event, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes all staffing and equipment. Our services can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150. Please note that our prices do not include VAT, which would be added on top of the quoted amount.  

We pride ourselves on our kosher offerings, which are under the supervision of the Star-K. Our menu features a variety of dishes, including grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. Additionally, we can provide a fully stocked bar for an extra cost.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific requests in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your quick response. The pricing you mentioned fits within our budget, but I would like to negotiate the per-person fee. We are expecting around 100 guests, and if we can agree on a $70 per person rate, I believe we can move forward quickly.  

Could you also confirm if the $75 includes a selection of beverages or if we need to arrange that separately? I want to ensure we have everything covered for our guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need for budget considerations. I can agree to the $70 per person rate for 100 guests, which brings the total to $7,000 before VAT. However, the bar will need to be arranged separately. We can provide a range of beverage options if you're interested.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can easily adjust the menu to include vegetarian and gluten-free options if necessary. Please let me know if that works for you so we can finalize the details.
