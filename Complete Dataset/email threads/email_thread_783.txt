Dear Leah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making the event a memorable one.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including meat and dairy selections, with a focus on high-quality ingredients. Our pricing structure is typically based on a per-person cost, and for an event of this nature, we generally recommend a starting price of $85 per guest, which includes VAT. This price allows for a full three-course meal along with a selection of appetizers.  

If you expect between 100 to 150 guests, we can accommodate that range comfortably. Please let us know if you have specific dietary preferences or needs, as we do offer vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

I look forward to your thoughts and any additional details you can provide about the event.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is an important occasion for us, and we appreciate your flexibility. I wanted to confirm that we are looking at approximately 120 guests. I am interested in your menu options, particularly any kosher selections, and I would like to know if you could provide supervision under the Orthodox Union.  

Also, could you clarify whether beverages are included in your pricing? I am hoping to stay within a budget closer to $75 per person, if possible.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Leah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the importance of staying within your budget. We can offer a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, which includes a selection of both meat and pareve dishes.  

Regarding the beverages, we typically do not include them in the base price, but I can offer a beverage package that includes wine and soft drinks for an additional $15 per person. If we adjust the menu slightly, I believe we can meet your budget of $75 per person for the food alone.  

Please let me know if that works for you, and I will provide a detailed menu for your review.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility and for providing the details. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the kosher menu under the Orthodox Union supervision at the price of $75 per person for food. We will also take the beverage package, bringing the total to $90 per person.  

Please confirm that this includes VAT and let me know about the cancellation policy. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to finalizing the details.  

Best,
