Dear Jonathan,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to our clients' needs. For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring options such as grilled chicken, vegetable stir-fry, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which typically ranges between $35 to $50 depending on the menu selections you choose. This price includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests for this event.  

In terms of dietary options, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free meals upon request. Additionally, our food is kosher and supervised by the OK Kosher Certification. Please let me know if you would like to include a bar service, which would be an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your thoughts so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the range you've provided, but I was hoping to keep the cost closer to $40 per person. Given our expected guest count, this would help us stick to our budget.  

Could you confirm if the price includes the bar service, or is that separate? Additionally, I’d like to know more about the cancellation policy, just in case our guest count changes.  

Thanks again for your assistance, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Jonathan,  

I completely understand your budget considerations. We can adjust the menu slightly to fit your price point of $40 per person. The bar service is indeed an extra cost, starting at $15 per person for a basic selection of wines and beers.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to seven days before the event date for a full refund of any deposits made. After that period, we would retain a 50% cancellation fee.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu selections.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. I’m happy to proceed with the adjusted menu at $40 per person, which brings the total to $6,000 for 150 guests. We will also opt for the bar service, bringing the total to $7,500.  

I appreciate your flexibility and the information regarding the cancellation policy. Let’s move forward with this arrangement. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience.
