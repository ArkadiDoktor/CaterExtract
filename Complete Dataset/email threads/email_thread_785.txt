Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the proposal. The menu sounds great, especially the grilled salmon. I do have a few questions before we proceed. Is the pricing of $50 per person inclusive of VAT? Additionally, can you confirm whether the food will be under proper kosher supervision? I would also like to know if beverages are included in that price or if they are separate.  

I am considering around 150 guests, so please let me know if that affects the pricing.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $50 per person pricing does not include VAT, which is added on top. Regarding kosher supervision, all our kosher meals are certified by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards. Beverages are not included in the initial price but can be added for an additional charge of $15 per person.  

For 150 guests, the total would be $7,500 plus VAT. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if there are any other adjustments you'd like to discuss.  

Best,
