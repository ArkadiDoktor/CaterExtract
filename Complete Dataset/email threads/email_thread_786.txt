Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your catering needs for the upcoming wedding on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

Our catering packages include a variety of options, tailored to suit different tastes and dietary requirements. For a wedding, we typically recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, starting at $75, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT and a selection of beverages, though a full bar service would be an additional cost.  

We ensure that all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the local rabbi, and we can accommodate various dietary needs upon request. Our team will also handle setup and staffing to ensure everything runs smoothly on the day.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific preferences for the menu.  

Best regards,  
David Roth

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the details about your catering options. I appreciate the flexibility in accommodating dietary needs, as we expect a diverse group of guests. However, I was wondering if you could adjust the pricing slightly if we were to finalize the count closer to the maximum of 200 guests. Is there any room for negotiation on the per-person rate?  

Additionally, could you provide some examples of menu highlights that you typically offer? The couple is particularly interested in unique dishes that would impress their guests.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. I can offer a slightly reduced rate of $70 per person if you confirm the maximum count of 200 guests. This rate will still include VAT and a selection of beverages, although a full bar will still be an additional cost.  

As for the menu, we often serve dishes like herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable medley, and a variety of gourmet salads. We also have delicious dessert options such as mini cheesecakes and fruit tarts. We can certainly work with the couple to create a customized menu that reflects their tastes.  

Please let me know if this adjusted pricing works for you, and we can move forward with the details.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised proposal. I’m happy to proceed with your offer of $70 per person for 200 guests, which totals $14,000. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our needs and the menu options sound fantastic. We will need to discuss the full bar service separately, but let’s start with the catering first.  

As for the cancellation policy, could you confirm the terms? I want to ensure everything is clear as we finalize this arrangement.  

Thanks again for your assistance. I look forward to working with you.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson
