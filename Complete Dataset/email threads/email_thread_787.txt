Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on June 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can create a tailored menu to suit your needs. For this event, I recommend our mixed menu, which includes options for both meat and dairy dishes.  

We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing typically ranges from $45 to $75 per person, depending on the final menu selections. This price includes VAT, and we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority if required. However, please note that beverages are not included in the base pricing.  

I would love to discuss your specific requirements further and help create a memorable experience for your attendees.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

I appreciate your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds promising; however, I’d like to clarify a few details. Since we expect around 100 guests, could you confirm if the $45 per person option includes vegetarian dishes as well? We'd also like to know if you can offer any gluten-free options for some of our attendees.  

Additionally, could you please specify what the cancellation policy is? This would help us finalize our decision.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. Yes, our $45 per person option does include a variety of vegetarian dishes, as well as gluten-free options to accommodate dietary restrictions.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notification at least two weeks prior to the event date for a full refund. After that, we can offer a 50% refund up to a week before the event.  

If you decide to proceed, I can finalize the menu and the total cost for 100 guests, which would amount to $4,500. This price includes VAT and the kosher supervision as discussed.  

Please let me know if you would like to move forward.  

Best wishes,
