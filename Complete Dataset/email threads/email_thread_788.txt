Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15. We would love to provide the catering for this special occasion. Our standard offering includes a diverse menu that features both meat and dairy options, ensuring there is something for everyone.  

We can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests, with a price of $60 per person. This total would include all necessary staffing, setup, and equipment, and we can assure you that all meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OU. Please note that our prices do not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final cost.  

Our menu can include items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and assorted desserts. If you have any specific dietary requirements, please let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate them.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a few points. We are expecting around 150 guests, but we might need to adjust the number based on final RSVPs. Would you be able to accommodate up to 250 guests if necessary?  

Also, can you provide more information about the beverages? We are considering a bar service and would like to know if that is included in your pricing or if it would be an additional cost. Additionally, could you confirm the dietary accommodations you offer?  

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt response. We can certainly accommodate up to 250 guests if required. Regarding the bar service, it is not included in the base price, but we can offer a selection of beverage packages that start at $25 per person.  

As for dietary options, we are equipped to provide gluten-free and vegetarian meals, and we can work with you to create specific menus for guests with allergies or other dietary restrictions.  

If you are ready to proceed, I can prepare a formal agreement for the total cost based on the number of guests you confirm.  

Looking forward to your decision.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the clarification regarding the guest capacity and beverage options. Based on our current estimates, I would like to proceed with an order for 150 guests with the inclusion of the beverage package. This brings us to a total of $12,750, including VAT.  

Please confirm that the menu will feature the items we discussed, including the herb-roasted chicken and grilled vegetable platters, and that all food will be kosher under OU supervision. I would also like to confirm the cancellation policy as we finalize the details.  

Once I have your confirmation, I will send over the deposit to secure the date.
