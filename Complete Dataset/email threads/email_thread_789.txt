Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and for the detailed information. I appreciate the kosher options you provide. However, I am wondering if there’s any flexibility in the price per person, as our budget is a bit tighter than expected. Could you possibly offer a reduced rate for a larger group, or is there a fixed price?  

Also, could you clarify if the $45 includes everything, including gratuities and setup? Lastly, we’re considering around 150 guests.  

Thank you,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to work within a budget. For a group of 150 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of $40 per person. This price includes setup and service staff but does not cover gratuities, which are appreciated but at your discretion.  

In terms of menu options, we can include a selection of dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a variety of salads. Please let me know if this works for you, and if you have any specific dietary accommodations we should consider.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details.  

Best,
