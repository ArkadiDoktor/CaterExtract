Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed a significant event for us, and we want to ensure everything is perfect. I appreciate the starting price you mentioned, but given our budget constraints, could we possibly discuss a lower price point or some flexibility with the menu options?

Additionally, could you clarify whether the food will be kosher? We have a diverse group of attendees, and it would be beneficial to know the supervision details. Also, we are considering including a beverage bar; what would that entail?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. We can adjust the menu to fit a price of $65 per person, still ensuring a delightful experience for your guests. As for the kosher requirements, all our dishes can be prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, so you can rest assured. 

Regarding the beverage bar, it typically adds about $15 per person and includes a selection of wines, beers, and non-alcoholic drinks. Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.

Best regards,
