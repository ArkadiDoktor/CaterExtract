Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Mark Thompson, and I represent Culinary Delights. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala scheduled for November 15th, which will accommodate between 100 to 150 guests. We would be delighted to help make your event memorable with our catering services.  

Our pricing is typically structured at $45 per person, which includes a diverse menu featuring options like grilled salmon, herb-crusted chicken, and a delightful selection of vegetarian dishes. Please note that this price includes VAT. We can also discuss dietary accommodations if there are specific needs, such as gluten-free or vegan options.  

If you would like, we can arrange for a bar service at an additional cost. I look forward to hearing from you to discuss this further and tailor the menu to suit your guests' preferences.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing and menu options sound appealing. However, I would like to clarify if the $45 per person covers all food or if there are additional charges for specific menu items. Additionally, could you confirm if your offerings are kosher and under what supervision? We have guests who observe kosher dietary laws, and I want to ensure we meet their needs.  

Also, what is your cancellation policy? It’s important for us to have clarity on that as we finalize the details.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person covers the entire menu, including a selection of our most popular dishes. I can confirm that our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to two weeks before the event with a full refund, while cancellations made within that period will incur a 50% fee. If you decide to proceed, I can also include the bar service for an additional $15 per person.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Please let me know if you need any further information from my side to finalize our agreement. I’m looking forward to working together to make this event a success.
