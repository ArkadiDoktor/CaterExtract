Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for November 15th. We would be thrilled to provide catering services for this event. Our menu offers a variety of options, including meat, dairy, and vegetarian dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For pricing, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes all setup and staffing. This price covers a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. We can provide a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Some highlights from our menu include herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a variety of fresh salads.  

Please note that beverages, including a bar service, are not included in this pricing but can be arranged separately. We also accommodate dietary restrictions, so please let us know of any specific needs.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, but I was hoping to negotiate the pricing a bit. Would you be open to a per person rate of $40 if we confirm for 80 guests? Also, could you clarify if VAT is included in that price?  

I appreciate the options for dietary accommodations, and I will compile any specific requests as soon as possible.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in working with us. I can offer you the $40 per person rate for 80 guests, bringing the total to $3,200. Please note that this price does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final invoice.  

We are happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions you may have, and we can finalize the menu once we have your confirmed guest list. Additionally, we have a cancellation policy that allows for changes up to 10 days prior to the event date without incurring a fee.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Best,
