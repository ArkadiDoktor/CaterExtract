Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate the details you provided. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit, as our budget is somewhat tighter than anticipated. Would it be possible to decrease the price to $50 per person?  

I also wanted to confirm whether beverages are included in that price or if they will be an additional cost. Lastly, could you please clarify your cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding the budget, and I appreciate your honesty. I can offer the price of $50 per person, but this would mean simplifying the menu slightly. Beverages would be an additional cost, but we can provide a range of options to suit your needs.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund. If cancellation occurs within 14 days, we retain a 50% deposit.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I’ll prepare a formal agreement.
