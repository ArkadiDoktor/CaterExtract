Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the corporate event you are organizing on November 15th. We would love the opportunity to provide catering services for your guests. Our menu can be customized to suit your needs, and we offer a variety of options including meat, dairy, and mixed dishes.  

For this event, we typically charge $50 per person, and the minimum guest count is 50, with a maximum of 150. This price includes VAT, and we can accommodate various dietary restrictions upon request. We also offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there are specific menu items you have in mind.  

Best regards,

Hello Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. The event will likely have around 100 guests, and your proposed price seems reasonable. However, I am interested in knowing if there’s any flexibility with the pricing, especially if we decide to include beverages. Additionally, could you clarify if the menu would include more vegetarian options?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concerns regarding pricing and menu options. We can certainly adjust the pricing to $45 per person if you choose a mixed menu that focuses on both meat and vegetarian dishes. As for beverages, we can create a package that includes a selection of wine and soft drinks for an additional $15 per person.  

Please let me know what you think, and we can finalize the details.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your adjustments. I am happy to proceed with the mixed menu at $45 per person, plus $15 for beverages. This brings our total to $6,000 for 100 guests, which includes VAT. Could you please confirm that the kosher meals will be prepared under the Orthodox Union supervision and that we will have adequate staffing for setup and service? I look forward to your confirmation so we can finalize our agreement.
