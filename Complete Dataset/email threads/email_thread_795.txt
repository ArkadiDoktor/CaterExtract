Dear Emily,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering services for your upcoming wedding reception on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. Our team specializes in providing high-quality kosher meals, supervised under the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we can offer a range of menu options featuring a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes. Some highlights include roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a variety of vegetarian options. We can accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan meals.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $75, which includes VAT. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests and can cater up to 200. Beverages and bar services are not included in this price but can be arranged as an add-on.  

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you'd like to see a detailed menu. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. The menu options sound wonderful, especially the variety you offer. However, I was hoping to explore a lower price point if possible, as we are working within a budget. Would you be open to discussing a fixed price for the entire event if we confirm a guest count closer to the maximum?  

Also, could you clarify the cancellation terms? It would give us peace of mind as we finalize our plans.  

Best,

Dear Emily,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to work within your budget. If you can confirm a guest count of at least 150, I can offer a fixed price of $10,500 for the full service, which would include everything discussed, and we can finalize the menu together.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund, but I can make an exception and offer a 50% refund if canceled within a week of the event. Please let me know if these adjustments work for you.  

Best,
