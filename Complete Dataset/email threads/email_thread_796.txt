Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this event.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically recommend our mixed menu, featuring a variety of meats, vegetarian options, and pareve dishes to accommodate all dietary needs. Our pricing structure is set at $65 per person, which includes all food items, staffing, and setup. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please note that beverages and bar service would be an additional cost, but we can certainly discuss options if you are interested.  

I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, but could you clarify if the $65 pricing includes VAT? We are expecting around 100 guests, but we might have a few more, so I’d like to know the maximum capacity you can accommodate.  

Also, we do have some guests with dietary restrictions, particularly gluten-free and vegan options. Are these available within the menu you mentioned? Lastly, could you provide details on the cancellation policy?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The $65 per person price does include VAT, so there won’t be any additional charges there. We can comfortably accommodate up to 150 guests, so you should be well within our capacity.  

Regarding dietary options, we can certainly offer gluten-free and vegan dishes upon request. For the cancellation policy, we typically require notice at least ten days prior to the event for a full refund. If you need to cancel closer to the date, we can discuss partial refunds depending on the circumstances.  

Let me know if you’d like to move forward, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Warm regards,  
Michael Thompson
