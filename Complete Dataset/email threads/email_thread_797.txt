Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. The price per person seems reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify whether the $50 includes VAT or if that would be added later. Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are included in that price?  

We expect around 100 guests and would love to see a proposed menu that includes some of the highlights you mentioned. If we proceed, I’d also like to understand your cancellation policy should anything change on our end.  

Thank you for your assistance!

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. The $50 per person price does include VAT, so there won't be any surprises later. However, beverages are not included; we can provide a bar service for an additional $15 per person if that interests you.  

I will prepare a sample menu for your review that features our most popular dishes, including herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetable platters. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks in advance.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I look forward to finalizing the details!  

Best regards,
