Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would be delighted to assist you.  

For an event of this nature, we typically offer a range of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed selections, all of which can be tailored to suit your guests' dietary needs. Our pricing is set at £50 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. This price includes VAT.  

We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din. Additionally, we can arrange beverages, including a bar service, at an extra cost, should you require it.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or if you have any questions.  

Best regards,

Hi Simon,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The £50 per person pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there is any flexibility regarding the final price, especially if we end up with closer to 100 guests. Additionally, could you provide me with more details on the types of dishes available? We are particularly interested in ensuring we have vegan options available for some attendees.  

I appreciate your mention of kosher supervision. This is important for us, and knowing that it falls under the London Beth Din gives us peace of mind.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your interest and your inquiries. For a group of around 100 guests, I can adjust the price to £45 per person, which would bring your total to £4,500, inclusive of VAT.  

Regarding the menu, I recommend our herb-crusted chicken, ratatouille, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can also include a couple of delicious vegan options, such as a quinoa-stuffed bell pepper and a creamy vegan pasta.  

If you require any last-minute changes or additional dietary accommodations, just let me know. We can discuss setup and staffing to ensure everything runs smoothly on the day.

Hi Simon,  

Thank you for the revised quote and the detailed menu suggestions. I appreciate your flexibility, and I would like to proceed with the catering service for 100 guests at the price of £4,500. Please confirm that this includes the kosher supervision and that cancellation terms are agreeable within a week of the event.  

Once confirmed, I’ll finalize the menu choices and any additional requirements.
