Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide the catering services for your event. Our menu can accommodate a variety of preferences, including kosher options, and we ensure that all dishes are prepared under strict supervision by a local rabbi.  

For a guest count ranging from 50 to 150, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes a selection of main courses, appetizers, and desserts. Beverages are not included in this pricing, but we can certainly provide a bar package if that interests you. Our pricing structure includes VAT, so you will not have to worry about additional charges on that front.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or requests, and I will be happy to assist.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Daniel from Gourmet Delights

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details provided. I have a few questions regarding the menu. Could you please clarify what types of dishes are included in the $45 per person pricing? Also, I would like to know if you can accommodate vegan and gluten-free options for some of our guests.  

Regarding the bar, we may be interested, so I would like to hear more about what you offer there. Additionally, could you confirm the cancellation terms?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear back from you. Our standard menu includes a mix of meat and dairy dishes, featuring items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platter, and assorted desserts. We can certainly provide vegan and gluten-free options upon request.  

For the bar, we offer a range of packages, starting at $15 per person for a basic selection of wines and beers. As for cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event to avoid any cancellation fees.  

If you confirm the guest count and any additional requirements, I can finalize the pricing and details for you.  

Best,  
Daniel

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the information. After reviewing everything, I’m pleased to confirm that we would like to move forward with the catering for 100 guests at the $45 per person rate, bringing the total to $4,500, including VAT. Please include the vegan options as discussed and the basic bar package.  

I understand the need for a two-week cancellation notice, so I’ll make sure to keep that in mind. Please send over the contract and any other necessary details at your earliest convenience.  

Looking forward to a successful event!  

Best,
