Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your corporate event on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services. We specialize in a diverse menu that can cater to various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For your event, we typically charge $45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options like grilled salmon, roasted vegetable platters, and a selection of desserts. We do have a minimum guest requirement of 50 and can accommodate a maximum of 200 guests. Our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a full bar service upon request for an additional fee.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu options or if you have any other questions.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I’m glad to hear that your meals are kosher, and the menu options sound appealing. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, is there any flexibility in the per-person rate? Also, does the quoted price include VAT, or will that be added later?  

We are expecting around 120 guests, and I’d like to ensure that we can provide a complete experience without exceeding our budget.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. While our standard rate is $45 per person, I can offer you a special rate of $40 per person if we finalize the agreement by next week. This price does include VAT.  

If you decide to go ahead, we can provide a choice of 2 meat options, 1 vegetarian option, and a dessert table. We can also assist with setup and staffing for the event. Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any further adjustments you’d like to discuss.  

Best regards,
