Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your detailed information regarding your services. We are indeed planning a wedding on December 15th, and I’m glad to hear that you can accommodate kosher meals. However, I would like to confirm that the supervision is under a reliable authority as this is crucial for us.  

Also, could you clarify if the $75 per person includes beverages, or would that be an additional cost? We are expecting around 100 guests, but that could vary slightly.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for clarifying your needs. I can confirm that our kosher meals are supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet all required standards. As for beverages, the $75 per person does not include them, but we can offer a bar package at an additional $15 per person if you are interested.  

With 100 guests, the total would amount to $7,500 for the catering service alone. However, we can work with you on the menu to include a variety of options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of desserts that cater to different dietary needs.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at $7,500, excluding the bar package for now. We appreciate the kosher supervision and your menu suggestions, especially the grilled chicken and desserts.  

Please send over the contract, including your cancellation policy, so we can finalize everything. I am looking forward to working with you to make this wedding a success!
