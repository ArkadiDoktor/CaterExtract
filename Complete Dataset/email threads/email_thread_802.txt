Hi Mark,  

Thanks for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. I have a few questions regarding the menu and pricing. Since we are expecting around 100 guests, could you confirm if the $45 per person rate includes all menu items, or are there additional costs for specific dishes?  

Additionally, we would prefer a menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options, but I would like to know if you could also offer gluten-free selections for some attendees. Lastly, can you clarify your cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person does cover our standard menu, which includes both meat and vegetarian options, without additional charges for specific dishes. We can certainly provide gluten-free selections as well, ensuring all dietary needs are met.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for any cancellations, which will allow you to receive a full refund.  

If this sounds good, I can prepare a formal contract for your review.
