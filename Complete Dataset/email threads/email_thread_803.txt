Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on December 10th. We would be delighted to assist you in creating a memorable experience for your guests.  

We specialize in a mixed menu, featuring options such as grilled salmon, herb-crusted chicken, and a variety of seasonal vegetarian dishes.

Please note that we can accommodate between 100 to 250 guests.  

All our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets your dietary requirements. We also offer a range of dietary accommodations, including gluten-free and vegan options.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the quick response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The menu sounds promising, but I would like to discuss the pricing a bit more. The starting rate of $65 per guest is a bit higher than we had anticipated. Is there any flexibility in that price, particularly if we can confirm a minimum of 150 guests? Additionally, could you confirm whether VAT is included in that price?  

I’m also curious if beverages are part of the package or if that would be an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. If you can guarantee a minimum of 150 guests, I can offer you a revised rate of $60 per person. This price does not include VAT, which will be added on top.  

Regarding beverages, I apologize for the oversight; they are not included in the package. However, we can create a customized beverage package for you, which can be tailored to fit your budget and preferences.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for adjusting the pricing; I appreciate your flexibility. The revised rate of $60 per guest works for us, and I understand the VAT will be added. For the beverages, I would like to receive a proposal for a package that includes wine and soft drinks.  

With that in mind, I would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests, bringing the total to $9,000, exclusive of VAT. Could you please outline the cancellation policy and any setup requirements you might have?  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
