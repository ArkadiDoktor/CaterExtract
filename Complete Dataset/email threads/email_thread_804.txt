Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you in making this event a success.  

Our standard offerings include a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. For your event, we recommend a selection of hors d'oeuvres, a main course of herb-crusted chicken, and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert. We are also able to accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, if needed.  

For pricing, our rate is set at $75 per person, which includes setup and service staff, and we ask for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that this price does not include beverages, but we can arrange a bar service if desired. All prices are exclusive of VAT.  

When you have a moment, please let us know your preferences, and we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details. However, I would like to clarify whether the $75 price per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top. Additionally, could you provide more information about the bar service options?  

I am also considering a guest count of around 80, so I would like to confirm that the pricing remains the same for that number.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. To clarify, the $75 per person does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. Regarding the bar service, we offer a variety of packages that can include wine, beer, and cocktails, starting at $15 per person. For 80 guests, the pricing remains consistent at $75 per person, so your total would come to $6,000 plus VAT.  

Please let me know if you need any further details or modifications to the menu, and we can adjust accordingly.
