Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Event

Dear Hannah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would love to provide catering services for the event. We can offer a diverse menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options to cater to all dietary preferences. 

Our pricing structure is set at $65 per person, which includes the complete meal service. We typically accommodate a minimum of 50 guests, and we can host up to 150 guests comfortably. All food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K, and we can provide a selection of wines and soft drinks as part of our package.

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu items in mind.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a few details. Can you confirm if the $65 per person includes VAT, and are there options for dietary restrictions? I expect around 100 guests but might have a few more, so I’d like to know how flexible you can be on the maximum.

Also, could you provide a sample menu? I want to ensure that we have a good mix of options, including some vegetarian dishes.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Hannah,

Thank you for your questions. The $65 per person does include VAT, so there won’t be any surprises there. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, whether for allergies or specific diets. 

For the menu, I can suggest a few highlights: herb-roasted chicken, a quinoa salad, and a rich chocolate mousse for dessert. We can provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options without compromising on taste. 

As for the flexibility, we can handle up to 175 guests if necessary, with a cancellation policy of 14 days prior to the event. Please let me know if this works for you.

Best,
