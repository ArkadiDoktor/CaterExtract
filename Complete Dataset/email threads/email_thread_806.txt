Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for September 15th. We would love the opportunity to provide our services. Our catering options are diverse, and we can tailor a menu to fit your needs.  

For this event, we typically charge a fixed price of $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We also offer a mixed menu with options for dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian and gluten-free dishes. Please note that beverages are not included in this price but can be arranged separately.  

Let me know if you have any specific preferences or questions.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the information. I appreciate the flexibility with the menu options. I wanted to ask if there is any room for negotiation on the price per person, as we are trying to stay within a budget. Would you be able to offer a lower rate if we confirm a guest count closer to the minimum of 50? Also, could you clarify whether the $50 includes VAT?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Samantha,  

I completely understand the need to adhere to a budget. If you confirm 50 guests, I can reduce the price to $45 per person. Regarding VAT, that amount is included in the pricing. Additionally, we can provide a basic bar setup for an extra fee if that interests you.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, and I will send over a formal agreement.
