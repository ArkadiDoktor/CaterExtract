Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on April 15th. We specialize in providing catering services for events like yours, and I would be delighted to assist.  

We typically offer a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing is structured at a rate of $50 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater to a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 250.  

I would suggest a menu featuring roasted chicken, a seasonal vegetable medley, and a selection of desserts. As for beverages, we can provide a bar service at an additional cost if that interests you. Please let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss any specific requirements you may have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing, but I would like to clarify a few details before moving forward. Is the $50 per person price fixed, or could there be room for negotiation? Additionally, we are considering approximately 200 guests, but I am concerned about the bar service costs. Can you provide an estimate? Also, is your food kosher, and if so, what supervision do you have in place?  

I appreciate your help in finalizing these details.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your inquiries. The $50 per person rate is indeed fixed, but I can offer a slight reduction to $45 per person if you confirm the full guest count of 200. Our bar service typically ranges from $15 to $25 per person, depending on the selections, and we can provide a more detailed quote once we have a clearer idea of your preferences.  

As for kosher certification, our meals are supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet all dietary laws. We are able to provide a mixed menu, including options for those who are vegetarian or gluten-free.  

Please let me know if this pricing works, and we can finalize the details.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to proceed with your offer of $45 per person for 200 guests, which brings the total to $9,000. Please confirm that this price includes VAT and that the kosher meals will be under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. I would also like to include the bar service at the lower end of your estimate, so please provide a revised total for that as well.  

I appreciate your assistance, and I look forward to working together on this event.
