Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion.  

Our catering options include a diverse menu featuring a mix of meat and dairy dishes, all under reliable kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests. The cost is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can also provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar service would be an additional cost.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can offer gluten-free and vegetarian options upon request. Our team will also handle setup and staffing to ensure a seamless experience. Please let me know if you have any specific menu preferences or additional requirements.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I want to confirm if the $45 per person covers everything, including the beverages, or if we need to budget separately for those. We are expecting around 150 guests, but we might have a few more depending on RSVPs.  

Also, could you provide a sample menu? We want to ensure that the options align with our guests' preferences. Lastly, what are your cancellation terms? I just want to be clear on that in case our plans change.  

Thank you!  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person does cover a selection of beverages, but a full bar service would be an additional charge of $15 per person. We can certainly accommodate up to 200 guests if needed.  

Regarding the menu, I can provide a sample with some highlights, which may include roasted chicken with rosemary, a creamy pasta primavera, and a fresh garden salad. For cancellation, we typically require a notice of 72 hours to avoid any charges. If you’d like to move forward, I can prepare a final proposal with these details.  

Let me know your thoughts.  

Best,
