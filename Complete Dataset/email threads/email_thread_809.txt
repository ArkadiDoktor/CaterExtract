Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a variety of options to suit your guests’ dietary preferences. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests and will ensure that all food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.

Our menu features a delightful selection, including grilled chicken, stuffed mushrooms, and a range of vegetarian options. We also offer a selection of beverages, but I would like to clarify if you would like us to provide a bar service as well.

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I would be glad to adjust our offerings accordingly. 

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for the quick response and the detailed proposal. The menu you suggested sounds wonderful. I would like to confirm that the $75 per person price includes VAT. Could you please let me know if there are any additional costs associated with the bar service? Ideally, we would prefer to keep everything within a budget of $10,000 for around 125 guests.

Also, could you provide information on your cancellation policy? It's important for us to have that clarified.

Thank you,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your reply. Yes, the $75 per person price does include VAT. As for the bar service, we can offer a standard open bar at an additional $20 per person, which would bring the total to $95 per person. If you are looking to stay within your budget, we could also create a more limited beverage package for $15 per person.

Regarding the cancellation policy, we do require a notice of at least 30 days prior to the event for any full refunds. I hope this aligns with your planning.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Best,

Thank you for clarifying the pricing and cancellation terms. After reviewing our budget, I would like to proceed with the full catering service at $75 per person for our 125 guests, which keeps us within budget. Please prepare the selected menu with the grilled chicken and vegetarian options, and we will handle the beverages separately.

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to finalizing the details.
