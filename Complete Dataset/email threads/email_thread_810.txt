Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would be thrilled to cater your event.

For a gathering of 100 guests, we can offer a mixed menu featuring several options, including grilled chicken with roasted vegetables, a selection of gourmet salads, and a delicious chocolate mousse for dessert. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes all food preparations, setup, and service staff. This price is inclusive of VAT.

Additionally, we can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options to ensure all your guests are catered for. Please note that our meals are kosher, supervised by the OU, and we can also provide a bar service for an additional fee.

I look forward to your feedback and hope we can work together to make your event a success.

Warm regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. I appreciate the mixed menu options and the kosher supervision you mentioned. However, I wanted to clarify if the $45 per person covers everything, including drinks or if beverages are separate.

Also, we are anticipating between 90 to 120 guests, and I would like to ensure we can accommodate this range without affecting the pricing. Could you confirm the final price if we go with the maximum number of guests?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your inquiry. The $45 per person does not include beverages, but we can offer a bar package that ranges from $15 to $25 per person, depending on the selections. For 120 guests, the total cost for food would be $5,400, and adding the bar package would bring the total to a maximum of $7,200, inclusive of VAT.

In terms of cancellation, we do have a policy that allows for cancellations up to two weeks before the event for a full refund of any deposits made. I hope this aligns with your expectations.

Let me know if this works for you!

Best regards,
