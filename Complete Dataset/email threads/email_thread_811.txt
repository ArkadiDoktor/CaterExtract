Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen from Tasty Catering Solutions, and I understand that you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th. We would be thrilled to provide the catering for this special event.  

We specialize in a diverse range of menus and can accommodate different dietary needs, including kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and can easily scale up to 200.  

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences for the menu or if you would like to discuss any additional details.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the preliminary details. I appreciate the starting price you've mentioned. However, could you confirm if that amount includes VAT? Additionally, I'd like to know if the price remains the same for the maximum number of guests, as we could potentially have up to 200 attendees.  

We are particularly interested in a mixed menu that accommodates both meat and dairy options. Could you provide some examples of the dishes you would suggest? Lastly, do your services include beverage options, or would that be a separate arrangement?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The pricing of $50 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. For the maximum of 200 guests, we can maintain the same per-person rate, provided the final count is confirmed two weeks before the event.  

In terms of the menu, we can offer a variety of dishes, such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. Our bar service is not included in the initial quote but can be added for an additional cost.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss specific dietary accommodations further.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I would like to proceed with the catering for our corporate gala on November 15th for 150 guests. The total comes to $7,500, including VAT. Please confirm that this includes the kosher supervision and the mixed menu options we discussed.  

I would also like to explore the bar service to see what options you can provide. Once confirmed, I will send over a deposit as per your cancellation terms.  

Looking forward to finalizing this with you.
