Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Culinary Delights regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We would be thrilled to cater this special event. Our team specializes in a range of menu options, including meat and dairy dishes, all of which can be tailored to fit your guests' dietary needs.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we typically charge $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Please note that this price does not include beverages, but we can provide a full bar service at an additional cost. All our meals are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can accommodate gluten-free and vegetarian requests as well.  

If you have any specific dishes in mind or need further information, please let me know.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to clarify the final cost. Does the $50 per person include VAT, or will that be added later? Additionally, we are expecting around 120 guests, but we need some flexibility in case the number changes.  

Would it be possible to include some wine pairings with the meal for an additional charge, and could you provide a sample menu with specific dishes? I appreciate your assistance as we finalize these details.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your follow-up. The $50 per person does not include VAT, which will be added on top at the standard rate. I can certainly accommodate your request for wine pairings with the meal. For the final price, once we confirm the guest count, I can offer a fixed rate of $6 per person for the wine service.  

Regarding the menu, I'm happy to provide a few sample dishes: we offer grilled lemon herb chicken, roasted vegetable pasta, and a decadent chocolate mousse for dessert. We can certainly work together to adjust the menu based on your preferences.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the arrangements.  

Best,
