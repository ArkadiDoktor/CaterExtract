Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the catering for your upcoming fundraising gala scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, and we can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. We offer a mixed menu, featuring both meat and vegetarian options, and we can certainly provide kosher meals under supervision by the OK Kosher Certification.  

Additionally, we can arrange for a bar service at an extra cost, or we can provide non-alcoholic beverages if that fits your needs better. Our service includes setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly throughout the event.  

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate it down a bit, given our budget constraints. Is there any flexibility on the per-person rate?  

Also, we may have around 120 guests, so I would like to confirm that this amount can accommodate our needs. Can you provide a sample menu with some highlights?  

I appreciate your help and look forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand your budget considerations, and I can offer a reduced rate of $45 per person for 120 guests. This includes VAT as well.  

For the menu, we can provide options like herb-roasted chicken, a delicious vegetarian lasagna, and a fresh salad bar. We can also include desserts such as chocolate mousse and fruit tartlets.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.

Hi David,  

I appreciate your willingness to adjust the pricing. The offer of $45 per person with the menu options you've shared sounds great. I would like to move forward with the agreement for 120 guests, including the kosher meals.  

Please send over the formal contract, including the cancellation policy and any additional details we should be aware of. I look forward to finalizing this soon.
