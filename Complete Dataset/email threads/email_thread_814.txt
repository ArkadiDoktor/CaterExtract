Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Based on the discussions, I understand you are expecting between 50 to 100 guests. We can provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options to accommodate various dietary preferences.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person basis, and we typically charge $45 per guest, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. This price also includes VAT. We can certainly provide kosher options under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. While we do not include a bar in our standard package, we can offer beverage service at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if this fits within your budget, or if you would like to discuss specific menu items.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing looks good, but we were hoping to keep costs lower if possible. Would you be able to reduce the per-person fee to $40 if we finalize the details soon? We would also like to ensure that the menu includes a variety of vegetarian options along with the meat dishes, as we have some guests with dietary restrictions.  

Can you confirm if the kosher supervision would apply to the entire menu? Additionally, could you provide a couple of sample dishes you recommend?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. I'm happy to adjust the pricing to $40 per person for your event, given that we move forward promptly. The kosher supervision will indeed apply to all menu items, ensuring that all dietary needs are met, including the vegetarian options.  

For the menu, I recommend our herb-crusted chicken and a roasted vegetable platter as popular choices. We can also provide a dessert option, such as mini cheesecakes. Please note that if you do decide to include beverage service, that would be an extra $10 per person. 

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the contract.  

Best regards,

Please send over the contract, and I will review the cancellation terms as well. I look forward to working together to make this event a success!
