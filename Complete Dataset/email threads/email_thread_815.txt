Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your event. We would be delighted to provide our services for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options to accommodate diverse dietary preferences.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, typically ranging from $45 to $60, depending on the selected menu items and number of guests. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards.  

We do offer a selection of beverages, but a full bar setup would be an additional cost. VAT is included in our pricing, so there are no hidden fees. Should you need to cancel, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund.  

I’ve attached a sample menu for your review. Please let me know if you have specific preferences or any dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the sample menu. I appreciate your flexibility with the meat and vegetarian options. I wanted to clarify a couple of points before making a decision.  

Given that we are expecting around 120 guests, could you confirm if the higher-end menu options are available at that number? Also, could you provide more details about the beverage options? We are considering adding a bar, but we want to keep the overall budget in mind.  

Looking forward to your insights,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. For a guest count of 120, we can indeed accommodate the higher-end menu options, which include dishes such as herb-crusted beef and roasted vegetable tart. In terms of beverages, we offer a selection of soft drinks and wines included in the per-person price, but for a full bar service, it would be an additional $15 per person.  

If you decide to go with the full bar, the total would then be approximately $60 per person. This also includes our staff for setup and service during the event. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. After reviewing the options, I would like to proceed with the higher-end menu, including the full bar service for 120 guests. This brings our total to $7,200, which fits within our budget. I appreciate that VAT is included in this price.  

Could you please provide a formal agreement outlining the details we discussed? Additionally, I would like to confirm the cancellation policy, just to ensure we are aligned.  

Looking forward to finalizing everything soon.  

Best,
