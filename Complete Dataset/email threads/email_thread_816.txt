Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. A wedding sounds like a fantastic event to cater. I appreciate the pricing information and the kosher options available. However, I need to confirm a few details before moving forward.  

Would it be possible to negotiate the price to $60 per person? I’m also curious if the beverage package is included in that pricing or if it would be an additional cost. Lastly, could you please clarify the dietary accommodations you offer?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your response. I understand your budget considerations, and I can agree to the $60 per person rate. The beverage package is an additional cost, typically around $20 per person, which includes soft drinks, wine, and beer.  

In terms of dietary accommodations, we can provide gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options to ensure all your guests are catered for. Please let me know if you have any specific requests or additional dietary needs.  

Once we finalize the details, I can prepare a formal agreement for your review.
