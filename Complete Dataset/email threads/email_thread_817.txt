Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this event on April 15th. Based on your estimated guest count of 100, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, including dishes like herb-roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads.  

Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 80 guests and up to 150. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards. If you would like, we can also provide a bar service at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements, and I'll be happy to discuss options to cater to those needs. I look forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm pleased to hear about the availability and the menu options. The price of $45 per person seems reasonable, but could we explore a lower rate? Given our budget constraints, I was hoping for something closer to $40 per person, if possible.  

Also, could you clarify if the bar service is included in that price or if it would be a separate charge? Additionally, do you have options for guests with allergies, specifically gluten-free and nut-free dishes?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget considerations. We can adjust the price to $42 per person for the gala dinner, which still allows us to provide high-quality service and food. The bar service is indeed an additional cost, typically around $15 per person.  

We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and nut-free dietary needs with advance notice. Our team will ensure that all guests can enjoy the meal without concerns.  

Please let me know if this revised offer works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
