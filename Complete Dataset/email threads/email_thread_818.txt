Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala event scheduled for the 15th of February. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and would be delighted to provide catering services for your celebration. 

For a dinner service, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which usually ranges from $50 to $75, depending on the final menu selection. Please let me know the estimated number of guests, as we generally accommodate events with a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 200 guests. 

All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision, and I can assure you that we comply with all relevant dietary guidelines. Additionally, we can offer various dietary accommodations upon request. 

I look forward to discussing your requirements in more detail.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you've provided. We expect around 150 guests, so I’d like to explore the middle range of your pricing. Can you confirm if your quote includes VAT or if it will be added separately? 

Also, I wanted to clarify whether beverages are included in your service or if we need to arrange those separately. Given the nature of the event, it’s important for us to ensure everything is seamless.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thanks for your questions. The pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final invoice. For beverages, we typically do not include a bar service in our base package, but I can offer a beverage package that includes a selection of wines and soft drinks for an additional $15 per person. 

Considering your expected guest count, the total cost for 150 guests would be approximately $10,500, including the basic food offerings. We can also finalize the menu to suit your preferences, with options such as herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetable lasagna. 

Please let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I’d be happy to draw up a formal agreement. 

Best,
