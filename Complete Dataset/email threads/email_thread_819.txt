Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala on April 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special event. We specialize in a diverse menu that features a mix of meat and dairy options, along with various vegetarian selections to accommodate all dietary preferences.  

For pricing, we generally charge $75 per person, which includes all food preparation, setup, and staff for the duration of the event. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that all prices include VAT.  

Additionally, our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can offer a variety of dishes, including grilled salmon, chicken piccata, and vegetarian lasagna. Unfortunately, our packages do not include any bar services, but we can recommend local vendors who can assist with that.  

If you have any specific requests or questions, please let me know.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety in your menu options, and I think the pricing is reasonable. However, I am looking to reduce costs a bit, especially as we are also considering additional entertainment for the evening. Would you be able to lower the price to $65 per person? We are still expecting around 100 guests.  

Also, could you clarify if the meals would include any gluten-free options? That would be very helpful for some of our attendees.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your concerns about the budget. I can accommodate the price of $65 per person, but this would necessitate a slight adjustment in the menu. We can still provide a wonderful selection, including our popular grilled chicken and a vegetarian pasta dish, along with gluten-free options.  

Regarding the guest count, 100 is perfect, and I can assure you that our team will ensure a smooth setup and service during the event. Please keep in mind that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
