Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights. We would be delighted to cater your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. Our team specializes in providing exceptional dining experiences, and we can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests for your event.  

We offer a range of menu options, including a mixed cuisine selection that features meat, vegetarian, and vegan dishes, all designed to cater to various dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is set at a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing, but does not include beverages. We also provide kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council.  

Please let me know if you have any specific menu requests or dietary accommodations you would like us to consider. I look forward to your reply.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher options available. However, I am wondering if there is any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we confirm a higher guest count. Additionally, could you clarify if VAT is included in the quoted price?  

I am also interested in knowing what specific dishes you would recommend for the gala. Looking forward to your insights.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. If you confirm a guest count of 150 or more, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person. The quoted price does include VAT, so you can budget accordingly. For the menu, I recommend our herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable medley, and a delightful chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Please let me know if this works for you, or if you have any other questions.  

Best regards,
