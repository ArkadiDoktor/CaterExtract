Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety of options you provide. However, I wanted to discuss the pricing a bit further. Considering our budget constraints for the charity gala, would you be open to negotiating the per-person cost? If there’s any flexibility, I believe we could finalize the arrangements soon.  

Additionally, I’d like to confirm that the kosher meals are suitable for a diverse dietary crowd. Can you provide more information on the specific menu items you would suggest for the event?  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply and for sharing your concerns. I understand the need to work within a budget for a charity event. I can reduce the cost to $70 per person if we can secure a minimum of 150 guests. As for the menu, I suggest a mix of classic dishes such as brisket, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

We can also include a dessert station with mini pastries and fresh fruit, which has been a hit at previous events. The kosher meals will be under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring they meet all dietary laws. My team is also well-prepared to handle any special dietary requests.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can go ahead and finalize the details.  

Best regards,
