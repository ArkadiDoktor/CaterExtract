Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this occasion. Our team specializes in a diverse menu, including options that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For a gathering of between 50 to 100 guests, we typically charge a fixed price of $40 per person, which includes a selection of both meat and dairy dishes. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K, ensuring it meets all dietary laws. While we do not usually include a bar in our packages, we can certainly make arrangements for beverages if required.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations, and feel free to ask any questions.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds great, but I wanted to clarify a few points. We are expecting around 80 guests, and I appreciate the fixed rate of $40 per person. However, could we consider a slight discount if we confirm the full 100 guests? Additionally, could you confirm whether VAT is included in that price?  

Also, I would like to know more about the menu options available, particularly any vegetarian or gluten-free dishes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. If you confirm 100 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $38 per person. Regarding VAT, I must clarify that it is not included in the initial pricing and would be added on top.  

We can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free options in our menu. For example, we have a delicious quinoa salad and a roasted vegetable platter that have been quite popular with previous clients.  

Please let me know if the updated pricing works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.
