Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our catering menu features a variety of options, including a selection of meat and dairy dishes, which can accommodate a range of preferences and dietary needs.  

For a wedding of this size, we typically recommend a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes a full buffet service. We can also provide a kosher option that adheres to supervision from the local Orthodox Union.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information about your menu options. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person price includes VAT or if that is added on top. Additionally, can you confirm whether beverages are included in that price?  

We are expecting between 80 and 100 guests and are particularly interested in vegetarian options for some of our attendees. Please send over the sample menu when you have a chance.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The price of $75 per person does not include VAT, which is an additional 10%. As for beverages, we typically offer a separate package, but I can provide a bar service at an additional cost of $15 per person, which includes soft drinks and wine.  

I will send a sample menu shortly, highlighting both meat and vegetarian options, including our kosher selections. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like to proceed with a booking.  

Warm regards,
