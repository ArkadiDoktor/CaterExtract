Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your catering needs for the upcoming charity gala on November 15th. We specialize in creating delightful menus for events like yours, and I would be thrilled to help you with this occasion.  

We can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, all under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, and we can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests. This price includes VAT, and I can send you a detailed menu featuring some of our popular dishes, such as herb-crusted chicken, quinoa salad, and assorted pastries.  

Please let me know if you would also require beverages, as they can be provided separately. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I would like to confirm whether the $50 per person covers everything, including setup and staffing. Additionally, we are expecting about 150 guests, so could you also provide a few options for dietary accommodations? Some attendees will need vegetarian and gluten-free meals.  

Regarding beverages, we are considering a separate bar service, but I would appreciate knowing your recommendations for non-alcoholic options that could be included.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $50 per person does include setup and staffing, which we will handle to ensure a seamless experience for your guests. For dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as part of our menu.  

As for beverages, we can offer a selection of non-alcoholic drinks as part of the catering package, but if you choose to go with a full bar service, that would be an additional cost. Let me know if you would like me to detail those options.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I would like to proceed with your proposal for the gala on November 15th, confirming 150 guests at $50 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and the dietary accommodations we discussed. Please ensure the menu features the herb-crusted chicken and quinoa salad, along with the vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

I will arrange for a separate bar service. Please send over the contract with the cancellation terms included, and we can finalize this promptly.  

Best wishes,
