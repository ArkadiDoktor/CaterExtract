Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming conference on November 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

We offer a variety of menu options to suit different tastes, including mixed cuisine that can accommodate various dietary needs. Our pricing structure is typically based on a per-person rate, and we can provide a detailed proposal once we know the expected number of guests. We recommend a minimum of 50 attendees and can accommodate up to 200.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I can tailor the menu accordingly. We also offer beverage packages, which can be included if needed.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your quick response. We are expecting around 120 guests, so that fits perfectly within your range. I would appreciate it if you could provide a quote based on that number. Ideally, we would like a mixed menu with vegetarian options available, and it should be kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Additionally, could you clarify whether the prices include VAT, and if beverages are included in your proposal? Please let me know about the cancellation terms as well.  

Thanks again!  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for the details. For 120 guests, we can offer a fixed price of $5,400, which includes VAT. The menu will be a mixed selection with kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We can include a beverage package with soft drinks and juices, but alcoholic beverages would be an additional cost.  

As for cancellation, we typically require at least a week’s notice for full refunds. I can provide a draft menu with highlighted items such as beef brisket, grilled vegetable platters, and assorted pastries.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over the contract.  

Best,
