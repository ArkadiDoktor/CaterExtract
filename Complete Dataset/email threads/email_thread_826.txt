Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming wedding celebration on June 15, 2024. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and can offer a diverse menu tailored to your preferences.  

We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, providing a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of gourmet vegetarian dishes. All our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards of quality.  

Please note that the final price includes VAT. We typically offer a full bar service, but that can be adjusted based on your preferences. We also cater to various dietary restrictions, so please let us know if you have any specific needs.  

I would be happy to discuss this further and answer any questions you may have.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the options you've provided. I wanted to clarify a couple of points. We are expecting closer to 120 guests and would like to know if you can accommodate that number at the same rate. Additionally, could you confirm if the bar service is included in the $75 per person price?  

Lastly, our wedding theme leans towards a mixed menu, with an emphasis on meat and some vegetarian options. If you could provide a few more examples of the dishes included, that would be great.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply and for the additional details. We can definitely accommodate 120 guests at the same rate of $75 per person. The bar service is an additional $20 per person if you choose to include it.  

For the menu, in addition to the herb-crusted chicken and grilled salmon, we could offer a savory brisket, stuffed zucchini, and a delightful quinoa salad. We are also flexible with dietary options and can adjust the menu based on your guests' needs.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement, and I can send over a formal agreement including the cancellation terms, which typically allow for changes up to one month before the event.
