Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this important event. Our catering services can provide a range of menu options tailored to your needs. For a gathering of 100 to 200 guests, we suggest a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

We typically charge $50 per person, inclusive of VAT. Our offerings can include items like grilled chicken with rosemary, a selection of seasonal vegetables, and a delicious chocolate mousse for dessert. Additionally, we can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request.  

In terms of beverages, we can provide an open bar or a selection of non-alcoholic drinks, but please note that these are priced separately. Once we finalize the guest count and menu, I can provide a more precise estimate.  

Looking forward to your thoughts!  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the catering options you've provided. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but could you confirm whether the food will be kosher? We have some attendees who require kosher meals, and it is crucial that we meet their needs.  

Also, I noticed the estimated price per person. If we are to move forward, could you clarify if there is any flexibility on pricing, especially if we finalize a guest count closer to the minimum of 100? Additionally, can you confirm if the price you quoted includes all the necessary setup and staff for the event?  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Yes, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Vaad of Greater New York, ensuring it meets the highest standards. Regarding the pricing, we can potentially lower the per person cost to $45 if you confirm the minimum of 100 guests. This price will still include the full setup and staffing for the event, but please note that the bar services will remain separate.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal proposal with all the details.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying the kosher supervision and the pricing structure. I am happy to confirm that we will move forward with 100 guests at $45 per person. This includes the setup and staff, as discussed. The final menu can be confirmed in the coming days, but I appreciate the options you provided.  

Please send over the formal agreement, including the cancellation policy, so we can finalize everything. Looking forward to working together!
