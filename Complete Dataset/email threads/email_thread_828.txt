Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Gatherings regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on the 15th of November. We specialize in providing quality catering services and would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

For a gathering of this nature, we can offer a mixed menu that accommodates various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We recommend planning for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150.  

All our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din. While our catering includes a selection of beverages, please note that a full bar service is not included in this package.  

If you’d like, I can send over a sample menu and discuss any specific requirements you might have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Samuel Green

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details regarding the catering options. I appreciate the mixed menu and kosher certification, as it aligns with our guests' needs.  

Could you provide a sample menu? Additionally, while £45 per person is within our budget, I would like to know if there’s any flexibility in pricing if we confirm more than 100 guests. Also, could you clarify if the VAT is included in the quoted price?  

I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for getting back to me. I can certainly provide a sample menu; I will include some popular dishes such as herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable risotto, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

Regarding pricing, if you confirm over 100 guests, I can offer a discounted rate of £40 per person while still including VAT in that price. This should help ease your budget concerns.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I will send over the sample menu right away.  

Best,

Hi Samuel,  

Thank you for the updated offer and the sample menu. I believe the revised price of £40 per person is reasonable, and I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests. I appreciate the flexibility you've provided.  

Please confirm that the final price includes VAT and that we are set for the 15th of November. Also, could you provide details on your cancellation policy?  

Once I have this information, I will be able to finalize everything.  

Best regards,
