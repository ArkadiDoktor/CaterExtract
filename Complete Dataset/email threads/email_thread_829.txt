Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming gala dinner on April 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for events and can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For your event, we offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes all necessary service and setup. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that our prices include VAT.  

We ensure that our food is kosher and supervised by the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, but the bar would be an additional service. If you have any specific dishes in mind, I would be happy to discuss that further.  

Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to proceed with a tasting.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The pricing seems reasonable, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, could you clarify if the $45 per person also includes dessert? Additionally, we are considering around 120 guests, and I would like to know if there’s any flexibility on the pricing if we exceed that number.  

We are also interested in ensuring some dietary accommodations for our guests, particularly vegetarian and gluten-free options. Please confirm if those can be included in the menu.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $45 per person does include a selection of desserts, and we can absolutely accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options within the menu.  

Regarding your guest count, if you exceed 120 guests, we can offer a discount rate of $40 per person for any additional attendees, which I hope works for you.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with a contract.
