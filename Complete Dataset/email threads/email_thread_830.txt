Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the cost if we end up with a larger guest list. We are expecting around 80 to 100 guests, so I would appreciate any options you might have for that range.  

Also, could you confirm whether the food is kosher? If so, what supervision do you adhere to? Lastly, we are considering including a bar service; would that be an additional charge?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Amelia,  

I appreciate your questions. For a guest list between 80 and 100, I can adjust the price to $65 per person, which still includes VAT. We do offer kosher catering under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary laws are strictly followed.  

Regarding the bar service, that would be an additional cost of $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines and beers. We can also provide non-alcoholic beverages as part of the meal service without additional charges.  

Please let me know if this works for you, or if you have any further inquiries.  

Best wishes,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised pricing and information regarding kosher supervision. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to proceed with the catering for 90 guests at the adjusted rate of $65 per person, bringing the total to $5,850, which includes VAT. I would also like to include the bar service at the additional $15 per person.  

Could you please confirm the cancellation policy and any other details I should be aware of regarding setup and staffing? Once I have that, I will finalize the agreement.  

Thanks again for your assistance.
