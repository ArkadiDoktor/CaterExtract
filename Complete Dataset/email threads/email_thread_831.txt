Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Catering Services regarding your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would love the opportunity to provide catering for this special event.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, ensuring all your guests have delicious choices.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dishes in mind or if you'd like to see our sample menu. We can also discuss beverage options, including a bar service if you're interested.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for providing the initial details. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the inclusion of dietary accommodations. However, we are currently considering a total budget of $4,000, which would mean we could only cater for around 89 guests at the proposed price.  

Could you let me know if there's any flexibility on the pricing, or if we could explore a more limited menu that might fit our budget better? Additionally, I’d like to confirm if the bar service is included or if that would be an additional expense.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback regarding the budget. To accommodate your needs, we could indeed offer a slightly simplified menu that allows us to cater for 89 guests at the original price. This would still include a selection of our popular dishes, like roasted chicken and vegetable lasagna, while ensuring all items remain kosher under the Star-K supervision.  

Regarding the bar service, it would be an additional cost of $15 per person, and we can provide a selection of wines and soft drinks. If you decide to go ahead, our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Please let me know if this adjusted proposal works for you.  

Best,

Thank you for your flexibility and for outlining the options. I would like to confirm our order for 89 guests with the simplified menu at $45 per person, totaling $3,985 which includes VAT. We will also opt for the bar service at an additional $15 per person, bringing the total to $4,680. 

I will ensure the final agreement is sent over shortly, and I appreciate your understanding of our budget constraints. Looking forward to a successful event!
