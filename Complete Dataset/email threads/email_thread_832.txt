Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights Catering. We specialize in providing delicious meals for various events, and I understand you are organizing a large conference on April 15th for around 200 attendees.  

We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $45 per person, which includes a variety of dishes to suit different tastes. Each meal can be tailored to meet dietary restrictions, and we offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.  

I would like to mention that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can provide beverages, but they are not included in the initial pricing.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your vision for the conference, and I can send over a more detailed menu for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response and the details you've provided. The fixed price of $45 per person sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to explore a bit of flexibility, as we might have anywhere from 150 to 220 guests depending on the final RSVP list. Could you confirm if this price remains the same for that range?  

Also, could you specify whether the $45 includes VAT, and if you would be able to offer a sample menu? It would be beneficial to see the proposed dishes, especially the meat options, as we want to ensure they appeal to a diverse audience.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns. The price of $45 per person does indeed cover a range of 150 to 220 guests, and I can confirm that VAT is included in that price.  

I will send over a sample menu shortly, but I can assure you that our offerings will include a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes, such as grilled chicken with herb sauce, quinoa salad, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can also accommodate any specific dietary needs upon request.  

Regarding cancellation, please note that we require at least 14 days' notice for any changes or cancellations to the order.
