Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this event for you. Our team specializes in creating memorable dining experiences, and we can offer a menu that includes a variety of meat-based dishes, perfect for an elegant evening.  

For this event, we typically charge $75 per person, and we recommend a minimum of 50 guests to ensure a smooth operation. This price includes VAT, and we can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions upon request. Please let us know if you require kosher options; if so, we can provide food under the supervision of the local rabbi.  

Additionally, we can arrange for a full bar service, or we can provide non-alcoholic beverages if preferred. We would need to discuss the details of your desired menu, but some highlights could include beef tenderloin, roasted vegetables, and a selection of artisan breads.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the initial proposal. The menu sounds appealing, especially the beef tenderloin. However, I wanted to clarify the pricing a bit. Since we are expecting between 50 to 100 guests, could we discuss a potential discount for larger groups? Additionally, I would like to confirm if the bar service is included in the $75 per person price or if it is an additional cost.  

Please also provide more details on the dietary accommodations you can offer. We will likely have a few guests who are vegetarian and gluten-free.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For groups exceeding 80 guests, we can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person. The bar service is indeed an additional charge, typically around $20 per person, depending on the selections you choose.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can easily prepare vegetarian and gluten-free options, such as quinoa-stuffed peppers and a delicious vegan dessert. We want to ensure all your guests feel included and satisfied with their meal.  

Please let me know if the adjusted pricing works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the adjusted pricing and the information about the dietary options. I believe the $70 per person for 80 guests works well for us, making the total $5,600. We would like to proceed with the kosher menu under the rabbi's supervision and include the vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please confirm that this price includes VAT and that your cancellation policy allows for a full refund if we need to cancel at least two weeks in advance. I look forward to receiving the final details so we can move forward.  

Best regards,
