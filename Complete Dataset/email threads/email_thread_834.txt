Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss your catering needs for the charity gala you are organizing on March 15. At Gourmet Catering, we specialize in a range of events and would be delighted to provide our services.  

We offer a diverse menu, including options for meat and dairy, and can accommodate various dietary restrictions if needed. Our pricing structure is straightforward, with a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar would be an additional cost. Please let me know if you would like to review our menu options or if you have any specific requests.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Thompson

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the details you provided. We are indeed looking for a mixed menu for the gala. Would you be able to offer any specific kosher options? We are expecting around 100 guests, and I want to ensure we meet all dietary needs.  

Also, could you clarify if the $75 includes everything, or if there are additional costs I should be aware of, particularly regarding the bar service? Lastly, I would like to know your cancellation policy in case our plans change.  

Best,  
Jessica

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your questions. I can confirm that we offer a kosher menu under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

The $75 per person covers the full meal, including VAT, but the bar service is an additional cost, typically around $15 per person for a selection of wines and soft drinks. As for cancellation, we have a flexible policy that allows for cancellation up to one week before the event without penalty.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a more detailed menu for your review.  

Best regards,
