Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights! We would be thrilled to cater your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We specialize in a variety of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing is structured at $85 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and dessert. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Please note that VAT is included in the quoted price, but beverages will be an additional charge.  

We are able to offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options, along with accommodations for any dietary restrictions you may have. Some of our popular dishes include herb-crusted beef tenderloin, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a variety of gourmet desserts.  

I look forward to your response to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed information. The wedding is indeed quite important to us, and we want everything to be perfect. I appreciate the mixed menu options and kosher certification. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. $85 per person is on the higher side for our budget. Would you be open to negotiating that?  

Additionally, could you clarify if the beverages include a bar service or just soft drinks?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your concerns regarding the budget. We would be willing to adjust the price to $75 per person if you can guarantee a minimum of 75 guests. This includes the same mixed menu options. As for beverages, we can set up a bar service for an additional $20 per person, or we can provide a selection of soft drinks without the bar for no extra charge.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility and can confirm the minimum of 75 guests. The adjusted price of $75 per person works for us, but we will stick with the soft drinks option rather than the bar. Please send over the contract, including the cancellation terms, so we can move forward.  

Looking forward to collaborating with you to make this event memorable.  

Best,
