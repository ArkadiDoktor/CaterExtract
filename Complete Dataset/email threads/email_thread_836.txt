Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on March 15th. We specialize in providing a range of menu options tailored to fit your event. For a celebration of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, and we can certainly accommodate any dietary restrictions your guests may have.  

Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a full buffet service. We generally require a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please note that the quoted price includes VAT.  

We also provide a selection of beverages, but please let us know if you would like a full bar service, as this can be arranged separately. All our food is kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

I would be happy to send over a sample menu and discuss any specific dishes you have in mind. Looking forward to your response!  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the quick response. The $75 per person price sounds reasonable, but we might have a slightly smaller guest list than your minimum. Could you accommodate 40 guests if we finalize the menu soon?  

I would like to see the sample menu you mentioned, especially any vegetarian options, as we have a few guests with dietary restrictions. Also, could you clarify if the bar service would be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your flexibility. For a guest count of 40, we can adjust the pricing to a flat rate of $3,000. This includes everything mentioned earlier, and we can certainly provide vegetarian options as part of the menu.  

Regarding the bar service, it would be an additional cost based on your selections, but I can provide a detailed quote once we finalize the menu. We typically recommend a selection of wines and non-alcoholic beverages for events like yours.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I’ll send the menu right away.  

Best,
