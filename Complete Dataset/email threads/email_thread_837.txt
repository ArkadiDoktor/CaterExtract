Hi James,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds appealing, and it’s great to hear that you can accommodate kosher meals. However, I wanted to clarify whether the price of £45 per person includes all meal options or if there are additional costs for certain dishes. Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are part of the package?  

We are looking at approximately 100 guests, and I’d appreciate it if you could provide a bit more detail on your cancellation policy as well.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The £45 per person includes a standard selection of dishes, but some premium options may incur an additional cost. Drinks are not included, but we can offer a beverage package at an additional £15 per person if you are interested.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice period of two weeks before the event for a full refund of any deposits made. Should you need to adjust the guest count, we can usually accommodate changes up to three days before the event.  

If you have any other questions or need further modifications to the menu, please let me know.  

Best,

As per our conversation, I understand the cancellation policy and find it acceptable. Please send over the contract so we can finalize everything.
