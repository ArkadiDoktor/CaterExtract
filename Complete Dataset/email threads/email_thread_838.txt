Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding on November 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater this special occasion. We can provide a wonderful selection of dishes, including roasted chicken, beef tenderloin, and a variety of vegetarian options. Our standard pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal, setup, and staffing. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.

We typically include VAT in our pricing, but please let me know if you need any additional services or if you would like to discuss bar options, as beverages are separate. Please feel free to ask about dietary accommodations; we can certainly provide gluten-free and vegan options as needed. 

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your detailed proposal. The menu items sound fantastic, especially the beef tenderloin. However, I would like to confirm whether the $75 per person includes the bar service, as we are considering a full open bar for our guests. Additionally, could you clarify the cancellation policy? We are expecting around 120 guests, and I want to ensure we can adjust if needed.

Thanks again for your help.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your prompt reply. The pricing does not include bar services, which we can offer for an additional $20 per person. As for the cancellation policy, we require a 30-day notice for a full refund of any deposits made. Given your expected guest count, we can finalize everything at a total of $9,000, inclusive of VAT, for the meal alone. 

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the arrangements.

Warm regards,
