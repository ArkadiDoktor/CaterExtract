Hi Daniel,

Thank you for the details. I appreciate the kosher supervision and the range of menu options. However, I was hoping to explore some flexibility in the pricing structure. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a fixed price for a set menu? We are also considering a beverage package and would like to know if that would be included in the per-person pricing or if it’s an additional cost.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I completely understand your budget considerations. While our standard pricing is 50 dollars per person, we can offer a fixed menu option for 45 dollars per person, which would include a choice of two appetizers, a main course, and dessert. However, beverages would be an additional charge of 15 dollars per person, which includes wine, beer, and soft drinks.

We can finalize the details soon, but please note that our cancellation policy requires a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event date. 

Let me know if this works for you, and we can draft a formal agreement.

Best,
