Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the initial details. The pricing looks reasonable, but given our budget constraints for the charity gala, we were hoping to keep it closer to $40 per person. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?  

Additionally, could you clarify if the food will be kosher? We want to ensure it meets the dietary requirements of our guests.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your response and completely understand the budget concerns. While our standard price is $50 per person, I can offer a special rate of $45 per person if we can confirm the minimum of 100 guests.  

Regarding the kosher option, yes, all our meals can be prepared under strict rabbinical supervision. We would be happy to provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy, ensuring all dietary needs are met. However, please note that beverages, including a bar, are not included in the initial quote.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can provide a detailed menu right away.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your understanding and the revised offer. I would like to accept the $45 per person rate for 100 guests, bringing the total to $4,500. I also appreciate the kosher preparation under rabbinical supervision. Please ensure that we can accommodate the gluten-free requests as discussed.  

I’d like to confirm that our gala will take place on March 15th, and we would require setup to begin by 5 PM. The cancellation policy you mentioned would be helpful to review as well.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details and receiving the menu.
