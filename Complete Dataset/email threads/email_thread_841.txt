Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to confirm our conversation regarding catering services for your upcoming wedding on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide a diverse menu tailored to your guests' preferences. Our standard pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests with a mixed menu featuring meat and dairy options.  

All food prepared will be under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all dietary requirements. We can also offer various beverage options at an additional cost, but please note that these are not included in the initial price.  

If you have specific dietary accommodations in mind, please let us know so we can make the necessary arrangements. I look forward to your response and hope to work together to make your event memorable.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding your catering services. The pricing is reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, we are considering around 120 guests, and I would appreciate it if you could provide a couple of menu highlights to help us make our decision.  

Also, since our guests may have various dietary restrictions, could you let me know what accommodations you can offer? I look forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your inquiry. The $75 per person pricing does include VAT, so there won’t be any additional charges on that front. For your event with approximately 120 guests, we can offer delicious options such as herb-crusted chicken, stuffed bell peppers, and a variety of desserts, including a chocolate mousse and fruit tarts.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as needed. If you could provide me with the specific restrictions, I can ensure we cater to all your guests' needs. Please let me know if you would like to move forward; I am happy to finalize the arrangements.  

Warm regards,
