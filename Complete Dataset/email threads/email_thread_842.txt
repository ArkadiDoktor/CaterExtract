Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. We're expecting around 120 guests, and I’d like to confirm that the menu can be kosher. Can you assure me it will be under proper supervision? Additionally, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes bar services, or would that be additional?  

I’m also curious about the cancellation policy in case our plans change.  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear from you again. Yes, we can certainly provide a kosher menu under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. The $45 per person does not include bar services; those would be an additional charge based on your selection.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, you may cancel up to two weeks before the event for a full refund. If you have any further questions or would like to finalize the menu, please let me know, and I’d be happy to help.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I would like to proceed with the catering for 120 guests, confirming the kosher menu under supervision. Since the bar services are additional, could you provide an estimate for that as well? I understand the cancellation policy, and I appreciate your flexibility.  

Once I have the final details, I will send you a confirmation. Thank you for your assistance.  

Best regards,
