Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I believe we can provide an exceptional menu that aligns with your event's needs.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we typically offer a fixed price of £45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring a selection of meat and dairy dishes. We can also accommodate various dietary needs, such as gluten-free and vegetarian options, upon request. Please note that VAT is included in this pricing.  

Our kosher meals are prepared under the supervision of the London Beth Din, ensuring all dietary laws are strictly followed. We also offer a variety of beverages, but please inform me if you would like to include a full bar service.  

I look forward to your feedback so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points. We expect around 120 guests, so if we proceed, would the pricing remain the same? Additionally, can you specify which dishes might be included in the three-course meal?  

I would also like to confirm that the bar service is not included in the initial quote. If we decide to go ahead with the full bar, how much would that add to the overall cost?  

Lastly, could you outline your cancellation terms? It’s important for us to know how flexible we are in case of any changes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The price of £45 per person will remain the same for 120 guests. For the three-course menu, we typically offer options like herb-crusted lamb, creamy risotto, and a selection of seasonal vegetables.  

Regarding the bar, our standard package would add an additional £15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

As for cancellation terms, we allow cancellations up to four weeks before the event for a full refund. After that, a 50% charge applies.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,  
Mark

I appreciate the cancellation policy and find it acceptable. Let’s finalize the agreement so we can move forward with planning.
