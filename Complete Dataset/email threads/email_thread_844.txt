For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy options, including dishes like herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

Please note that all our meals are kosher, prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We can also provide a bar service with a selection of wines and non-alcoholic beverages at an additional cost. VAT is included in the quoted price.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the prompt reply. The menu sounds excellent, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details. However, I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we are closer to the minimum number of guests. Additionally, could you confirm whether the bar service is included in the $75 per person, or is that a separate charge?  

We are also considering accommodating a few guests with dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free options. Could you please provide insight into what you can offer in that regard?  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your questions. I understand the need for flexibility, and I can offer a revised price of $70 per person if you confirm a guest count of 50. The bar service is indeed an additional charge, typically around $15 per person, which includes a selection of drinks.  

We can certainly accommodate gluten-free options as well, such as quinoa salad and grilled fish. Regarding the dietary needs, we can discuss additional options if needed.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

Thanks for the updated proposal. I’m happy to confirm the catering for 50 guests at the price of $70 per person, with the understanding that the bar will be an extra charge. Please proceed with the arrangements, including the gluten-free options.  

Additionally, I’d like to confirm the cancellation policy, just in case our plans change. Looking forward to seeing everything come together for the gala on October 15th.
