Dear Emily,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I am with Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand that you're organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to assist you with the catering needs.  

We offer a variety of menu options that can accommodate different dietary preferences, including kosher meals under strict rabbinical supervision. Our pricing starts at $45 per person and can vary based on the final menu selection. We typically cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200 guests.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the details further or if you have any specific requests in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your flexibility with the guest count. I’m interested in the kosher option, but could you provide more specifics on the menu items you usually offer? Also, I’d like to know if the $45 per person includes VAT or if it’s added on top.  

Additionally, we might consider including a bar or beverages for our guests. Could you let me know if that’s possible and what the pricing structure would look like?  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your questions. Our kosher options typically include dishes like herb-roasted chicken, vegetable lasagna, and a variety of salads, all under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. The $45 per person does not include VAT; it will be added at the standard rate.  

Regarding beverages, we can provide a full bar service at an additional cost of $15 per person, or you can choose a non-alcoholic drinks package for $8 per person. We can adjust the menu based on any dietary needs your guests may have, too. If you decide to proceed, we would need a final guest count and menu selection by November 1st to ensure everything runs smoothly.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed information. I would like to proceed with the kosher option, including the full bar service, for a total of 100 guests. This brings us to a final price of $6,000, including VAT. Please confirm if you can accommodate this setup. I also appreciate your flexibility with dietary needs, as we may have a few guests requiring gluten-free options.  

Please confirm this arrangement at your earliest convenience, and I will send over the final details and a deposit to secure our booking.  

Best,
