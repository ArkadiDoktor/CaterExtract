Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals and can tailor our services to meet your specific needs.  

For this event, we can offer a variety of menu options, including a delicious mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing starts at $50 per person, and we recommend a minimum of 30 guests, with a maximum of 100. This price includes all necessary setup and staffing, and I can assure you that our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision with the Star-K certification.  

Please let me know if you are interested, and I can provide a detailed menu and further information.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I’d like to clarify whether the $50 per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top. Additionally, while the minimum of 30 guests works for us, we are still assessing the final headcount, so I’d appreciate it if you could give me an idea of the maximum number of guests you can accommodate comfortably.  

Also, could you let me know if beverages or a bar service is included in the pricing?  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your questions. The $50 per person pricing does include VAT, so there will be no additional charges in that regard. We can comfortably accommodate up to 100 guests, but we can also discuss options for larger groups if needed.  

As for beverages, we typically offer a beverage package as an additional option. If you would like, I can provide you with details on that as well.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a proposed menu for your review.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing and guest accommodations. I would like to proceed with the catering for 50 guests, which brings the total to $2,500, including VAT. Please include a selection of both meat and vegetarian options, and I would also like to add the beverage package.  

Could you confirm the cancellation policy in case our plans change? I look forward to receiving the proposed menu soon so we can finalize everything.  

Best regards,
