Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. Our team specializes in creating exquisite menus tailored to your needs, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. 

We typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a variety of main courses, appetizers, and desserts. All our food is kosher, prepared under strict supervision by the local Kashrut authority, and we can provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. We also offer a selection of beverages, although please note that a bar is not included in the standard package.

If you have specific dietary accommodations in mind, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options, we would be happy to discuss those as well. Please let me know if you would like to proceed or have any questions.

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. I appreciate the clarity on pricing and menu options. However, considering our budget constraints, I would like to see if there’s any flexibility on the price per person. Is there a possibility to negotiate a lower rate, especially if we confirm the maximum of 150 guests? Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 price includes VAT? 

I look forward to your response so we can finalize the details soon.

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. While our standard rate is $75 per person, I can offer a reduced price of $70 per person if you confirm the booking for 150 guests. Regarding VAT, the price does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. 

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can start discussing the menu highlights and any specific requests you might have.

Warm regards,
