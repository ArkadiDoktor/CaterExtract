Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for April 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event.  

We specialize in a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, and we can certainly accommodate various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our pricing structure is based on a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes all food items, setup, and staffing. This rate applies to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests.  

Please note that our food is prepared under the supervision of the local kosher authority, and we can provide a selection of beverages as well, though the bar would be an additional charge. All prices mentioned include VAT.  

I look forward to discussing this further and helping make your event a success.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you provided. The menu sounds great, especially the mixed options. I do have a couple of questions before we move forward.  

Considering our budget constraints, would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $65 per person? Additionally, I would like to clarify if the bar service includes soft drinks and if there are any specific cancellation terms we should be aware of.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your response and for considering our catering services. I understand your budget concerns, and I can offer you a reduced rate of $70 per person, which still allows us to provide a high-quality experience. The bar service will include soft drinks, but alcoholic beverages will be priced separately.  

As for cancellation terms, you would need to notify us at least two weeks in advance for a full refund. I hope this works for you.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement.  

Best,
