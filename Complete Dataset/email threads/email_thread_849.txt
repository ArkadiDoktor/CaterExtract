Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your corporate event scheduled for March 15th. We would be delighted to assist in creating a memorable experience for you and your guests. 

We offer a variety of menu options tailored to corporate gatherings, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT. Additionally, all food is kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher Certification. 

We can also provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar service would be an additional cost. If you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, please let us know, and we will do our best to accommodate them. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The menu sounds great, especially the mixed options. However, I wanted to clarify if the $45 per person includes just the food or if it also covers beverages. We are expecting between 70 and 120 guests and would like to finalize the arrangements soon. 

Additionally, could you confirm your cancellation policy? It would be helpful to know how flexible we are in case of any changes.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person covers the food only. For beverages, we can offer a package starting at $15 per person for a selection of soft drinks and wines. 

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require at least two weeks' notice for any changes or cancellations. If we can finalize the guest count soon, I can ensure everything is in place for your event.  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at $45 per person, plus $15 for the beverage package. This brings the total to $6,000, and I appreciate that VAT is included in your pricing. 

Please confirm that the food will be kosher under OK supervision and that you can accommodate dietary restrictions as needed. I will also ensure that we adhere to the two-week cancellation policy. 

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
