Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. Since we are expecting around 150 guests, I would like to understand more about the specific dishes you can offer. We are particularly interested in a balance of meat and dairy options. Also, could you clarify if the prices you mentioned include VAT?  

Given our budget constraints, I would prefer to keep the total cost around $10,000 if possible. Please let me know if this is feasible with your offerings.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget considerations. We can certainly work within the $10,000 range for 150 guests, which would bring the cost to about $66.67 per person. This price includes VAT and covers a variety of menu options, including grilled chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of vegetarian dishes.  

We can also provide a bar service at an additional cost, should you decide to include beverages. Please let me know which direction you would like to take, and I will finalize the menu and send over the cancellation terms.  

Best regards,
