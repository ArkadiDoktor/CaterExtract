Dear Samantha,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel Cohen, and I represent Gourmet Delights, a catering service specializing in high-quality food for various events. I understand you are looking for a caterer for an upcoming wedding on April 15th. 

We offer a range of menu options, including mixed dishes featuring both meat and dairy, and can easily accommodate dietary restrictions such as vegetarian and gluten-free. Our pricing typically starts at $45 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests. This price includes VAT, and we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. 

Additionally, we can arrange for a bar service, which would be an extra cost. Please let me know if you would like to discuss menu suggestions or have any specific requests.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Daniel Cohen

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. For our wedding, we expect around 80 guests and would like to know if you can accommodate a fixed price for the catering, including the bar service. 

We are particularly interested in having a mixed menu, and it would be great to see some highlights. Also, could you clarify your cancellation policy? 

Thank you!

Dear Samantha,

Thank you for your inquiry. I can confirm that we can offer a fixed price of $4,200 for 80 guests, which includes the bar service. Our menu highlights include herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a variety of gourmet salads. 

Regarding our cancellation policy, you would need to notify us at least two weeks prior to the event to avoid any charges. Our kosher meals will be prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary needs are met.

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further questions.

Warm regards,
