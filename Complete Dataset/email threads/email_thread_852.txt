Dear Jennifer,  

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate conference on March 15th. We specialize in providing exceptional catering services tailored to your needs. For your event, we can offer a range of menu options, including both meat and dairy dishes, with an emphasis on fresh, seasonal ingredients.  

Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union if that is a requirement.  

Included in our catering package are main dishes such as herb-roasted chicken and quinoa-stuffed bell peppers, along with a variety of salads and desserts. Please let us know if you need any special dietary accommodations, as we can cater to vegetarian, gluten-free, and nut-free options.  

I would be happy to discuss further details or answer any questions you may have.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. I appreciate the variety of options you've provided. However, I was wondering if there is any flexibility in the pricing. We are expecting around 120 guests, but our budget is a bit tight. Is there a possibility to negotiate the price per person or perhaps adjust the menu to stay within budget? Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in that price?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,  
Jennifer

Hi Jennifer,  

I understand the constraints of budget and appreciate your transparency. While the standard price is $45 per person, I can offer a modified menu that would reduce the price to $40 per person if we limit the selection to three main dishes and two dessert options. As for beverages, our base package does not include a bar, but we can arrange a beverage station for an additional $15 per person, which includes soft drinks, coffee, and tea.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a revised menu based on this new pricing structure.  

Best,  
Mark

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I believe the modified menu at $40 per person works for us, and I would like to proceed with that option. Please prepare a final proposal accordingly, including the details for the beverage station. I also want to confirm that we will need the setup to be completed by 11 AM on the event day, and I would appreciate your assurance on the cancellation policy as well.  

Looking forward to your final proposal.  

Best,  
Jennifer
