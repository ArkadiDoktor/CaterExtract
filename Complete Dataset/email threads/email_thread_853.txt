Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on October 10th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event.  

We offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes that can accommodate various dietary needs. Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $45 per person, which includes setup, staffing, and equipment. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that this price does not include VAT, which will be added to the final invoice.  

In terms of supervision, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local Orthodox Rabbinate. We can also include a selection of non-alcoholic beverages, although alcoholic drinks would need to be arranged separately.  

I look forward to discussing this further and tailoring the menu to your specific requirements.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the details you've provided. However, I would like to clarify a few points.  

We are expecting around 100 guests, so I just want to confirm that the total cost would be $4,500 plus VAT. Additionally, can you provide more details on your dietary accommodations? We have a few attendees with specific dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your reply.
