Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Delish Catering for your upcoming corporate gala on December 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for events, and I believe we can offer a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 attendees, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and this includes all necessary equipment and setup. Please note that the price is exclusive of VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

Additionally, we can accommodate various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Our food is kosher and supervised by the local Kashrut authority. However, beverages and bar services would be an additional charge.  

If you have any specific requests or further questions, please feel free to reach out. I look forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate for a lower price per person, especially since we’re considering a guest list closer to 100. Is there any flexibility in your pricing structure? Also, could you clarify your cancellation policy in case our plans change?  

Best,  
Rachel

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your quick response. Given the larger guest count, I can offer a revised rate of $40 per person, with a minimum of 50 guests. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event date, which should give you some peace of mind.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if there are any further adjustments you’d like to discuss.  

Warm regards,
