Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. We specialize in providing high-quality kosher meals with supervision from the Orthodox Union, ensuring your guests enjoy a delicious and compliant dining experience.  

We can offer a mixed menu, featuring options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. Additionally, we can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing is structured at 50 dollars per person, which includes VAT. We recommend a minimum of 50 guests and can cater up to 150 guests. For beverage service, we typically recommend a separate bar package, as it is not included in our meal pricing.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, especially the inclusion of vegetarian options. However, I was hoping to clarify a few points.  

Is it possible to negotiate the price if we settle on a guest count closer to 75? Additionally, could you confirm if the 50 dollars per person includes all service staff and equipment setup, or should we budget for those separately?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your quick follow-up. For a guest count of 75, we can offer a reduced rate of 45 dollars per person, which would bring the total to 3,375 dollars. This price includes setup and service staff for the event. 

Please note that any changes to the guest count after the final agreement may incur additional charges, so we suggest confirming numbers as soon as possible. If this works for you, we can proceed with the arrangements.  

Best regards,
