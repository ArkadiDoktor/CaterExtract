Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your gathering.  

We specialize in a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, carefully prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing is structured at a rate of $50 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. This price includes VAT, and we can also provide a selection of beverages for an additional charge.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I can provide a sample menu that highlights some of our popular dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and decadent desserts.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. The mixed menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, the pricing is a bit higher than our budget. Is there any flexibility on the per person rate? Additionally, could you clarify if the beverage selection is included in that price, or would it be an added expense?  

Also, we expect around 100 guests, so I would appreciate a more detailed menu that includes any vegetarian options as well.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of staying within budget. I can adjust the per person rate to $45 if we can finalize the guest count at 100. The beverage selection would be an additional cost, but I can offer a package that includes a variety of soft drinks and juices.  

As for dietary options, we do have several vegetarian dishes available, such as stuffed bell peppers and quinoa salads, that can be included in the menu. I will send over a detailed menu shortly.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
