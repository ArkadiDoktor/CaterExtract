Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher options. However, I was wondering if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we consider the maximum guest count. Would you be able to offer a reduced rate for 200 guests? 

Also, I wanted to clarify whether the price includes staff for setup and serving, as well as what the cancellation policy looks like.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your feedback. For a guest count of 200, I'm happy to offer a reduced rate of $60 per person. This price still covers setup and serving staff, and I can confirm that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.

Please let me know if this adjustment works for you, or if you have any other questions regarding the menu or services.

Best wishes,
