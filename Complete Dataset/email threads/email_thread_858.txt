Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for considering Silver Spoon Catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would be thrilled to assist with your celebration.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options to cater to diverse preferences. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes a full buffet setup. This price also covers staffing and basic equipment needed for the event. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests comfortably.  

In terms of dietary needs, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as requested. All our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Please note that the beverage service is not included in the base price, but we can arrange a full bar for an additional fee.  

If you have any specific ideas or preferences for the menu, I would be happy to discuss them further. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision you mentioned. However, I was hoping you could clarify whether the $75 per person includes VAT or if it would be added on top. Additionally, could you provide a few examples of the specific dishes you would recommend?  

Lastly, we are expecting around 120 guests, so if we confirm, can you hold the date for us? If we decide to go ahead, I would also like to discuss the bar options a little more.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The pricing of $75 per person does not include VAT, which will be added to the final invoice. As for the menu, I recommend our herb-roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a selection of gourmet salads that have been quite popular in previous events.  

I can certainly hold the date for you, but please note our cancellation policy requires a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits. Regarding the bar, we offer a variety of packages that can be tailored to your needs, from a simple wine and beer option to a full open bar.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have further questions.  

Warm regards,

Thank you for clarifying the pricing and menu details. I appreciate the recommendations and the flexibility with the bar options. After discussing with my team, we would like to move forward with your catering services for 120 guests at the agreed price of $75 per person, plus VAT. Please confirm the total and the next steps. I will also ensure that we comply with your cancellation policy.  

Looking forward to finalizing this.
