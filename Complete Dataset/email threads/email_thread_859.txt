We offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes, with vegetarian and vegan accommodations available as well. Our pricing is structured at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150.  

In addition to the food, we can provide a bar service with a selection of wines and soft drinks, if you would like to include that as well. Please let me know your preferences, and I can send over a sample menu and further details.  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi David,  

Thanks for your prompt response and the details provided. The menu sounds fantastic, but I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding. Can you confirm if the £45 per person price includes the bar service? Additionally, we are expecting around 120 guests, but we might go slightly higher. Would the price remain the same if we reached 150?  

Lastly, could you provide more information on the kosher options and the supervision you have in place?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The £45 per person does not include bar service; that would be an additional £15 per person if you choose to go with it. If you have 150 guests, we can maintain the same rate of £45 per person, which is great news for your budget.  

Regarding our kosher options, all our meals can be prepared under the supervision of the London Beth Din, ensuring they meet kosher standards. We can offer a variety of dishes, including roasted chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a selection of desserts.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can draft a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification on the pricing and kosher supervision. I appreciate your flexibility with the guest count. I would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests at £45 per person, with the addition of bar service at £15 per person. This will total £9,000, including VAT.  

Please confirm the cancellation policy and let me know when we can finalize the agreement. I look forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Best regards,
