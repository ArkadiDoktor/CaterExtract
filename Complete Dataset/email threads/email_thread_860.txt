Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are planning a wedding reception on June 15th and are looking for catering options. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

Our pricing structure is typically around thirty-five dollars per person, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. We ensure that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Kashrut Authority, and we can provide a selection of representative dishes such as roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and gourmet salads.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific dietary accommodations or if you have any other questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information provided. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I'm wondering if there is any flexibility on the per-person rate, especially if we finalize the guest count soon. Also, could you clarify if the price includes VAT?  

Additionally, we are considering a bar package for beverages. Is that something you can accommodate, and if so, what would be the additional cost? I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your inquiries. While our standard rate is thirty-five dollars per person, I can offer a reduced price of thirty-two dollars per person if you confirm the minimum of 50 guests by the end of this week. The price does not include VAT, which is added at the standard rate.  

Regarding the bar, we can certainly provide a full bar service for an additional fifteen hundred dollars, which would include a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and I can prepare a formal proposal.
