Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We have extensive experience in providing catering services for such events, and I would be happy to assist you in creating a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

We offer a range of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed selections. Our pricing typically starts at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Please let me know if you have specific dietary requirements, as we can make adjustments to ensure all your guests are catered for.  

Our meals are kosher and under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, which guarantees the highest standards of kosher food preparation. However, please note that beverages are not included in the package.  

I look forward to discussing your preferences in more detail.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. The $75 per person price point sounds reasonable, but I would like to know if there are any options to lower the cost, especially if we decide to go with a simpler menu. Additionally, we may have around 120 guests, but I am currently confirming numbers.  

For the menu, could you provide some highlights, particularly for the main courses? I also want to ensure that you can accommodate vegetarian options, as some of our guests have dietary restrictions. Please confirm if the price quote includes VAT or if that would be added on top.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly provide a simpler menu option that could bring the price down to $65 per person. This would still include a variety of options, with highlights such as grilled chicken, stuffed eggplant, and a selection of salads. We can accommodate vegetarian meals as well, along with gluten-free options if needed.  

Regarding VAT, our quoted price does not include it, so that would be added at the standard rate of 10%. If your guest count does fluctuate, we can adjust the final pricing accordingly within the range of 50 to 150 guests.  

Please let me know if this adjusted proposal works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best wishes,

Hi Michael,  

I appreciate your quick response and flexibility with the menu. The adjusted price of $65 per person works for us, and we're happy to proceed with that offer. We will also finalize the guest count closer to the date, but I will keep you updated.  

Please prepare the formal agreement, including the cancellation policy, so we can finalize everything. I am excited to work together to create a wonderful experience for our guests.  

Thank you!
