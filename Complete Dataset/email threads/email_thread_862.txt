Dear Rebecca,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming charity gala on October 15th. We would love to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our team specializes in mixed-menu options that can accommodate various dietary needs.  

For a guest count between 100 to 150, our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We also ensure that all food is kosher, under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. Please note that beverages are not included in this pricing, but we can discuss bar options if you'd like.  

I’d be happy to provide a sample menu for your review. Additionally, we have a flexible cancellation policy that allows for full refunds up to two weeks prior to the event.  

Looking forward to your thoughts!  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the initial pricing details. The $75 per person seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit since we are working with a tight budget. Would you consider a fixed price of $70 per person for 120 guests? Also, could you clarify whether VAT is included in that price?  

I appreciate your offer of a sample menu, and I would love to see the options you have available.  

Best,  
Rebecca

Hi Rebecca,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand the need to stick to a budget, and I can agree to a price of $70 per person for 120 guests if you confirm the booking by the end of this week. The price does not include VAT, which will be an additional 8%.  

As for the menu, I will send over a couple of options shortly. We can certainly accommodate dietary requests, such as vegetarian and gluten-free choices.  

Let me know if this works for you.  

Best,  
Michael

Looking forward to finalizing the details!
