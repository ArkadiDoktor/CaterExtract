Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your corporate conference on November 15. We specialize in providing a variety of dining options tailored to suit different themes and dietary needs. For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes, all under strict kosher supervision by the OK Kosher Certification.  

Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes an assortment of appetizers, main courses like grilled chicken and roasted vegetables, and desserts. This price is inclusive of VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150, depending on your final headcount.  

Additionally, we can provide a full bar service at an extra charge, or we can include a selection of beverages in the package. Please let me know if you have any specific requests or dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the kosher supervision, as we have several attendees who require it. However, I wanted to check if you could adjust the pricing slightly, as our budget is a bit tight. Would it be possible to reduce the cost to around $40 per person? Also, could you clarify if the beverages included are soft drinks, or if it would be just water?  

Thanks for your help!  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your transparency. I can offer the adjusted rate of $40 per person, which will still include a selection of soft drinks along with water. This package will ensure all guests have options to stay refreshed throughout the event.  

Please note that this price remains inclusive of VAT and covers the same menu items mentioned earlier. If we finalize this arrangement, we would request confirmation at least one week prior to the event to ensure all preparations are in place.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move ahead with the details.  

Best,
