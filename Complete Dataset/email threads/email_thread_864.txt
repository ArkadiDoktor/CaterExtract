Dear Samantha,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event.  

Our menu offers a diverse selection of gourmet dishes, focusing on a mixed menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences. We can prepare everything from succulent beef tenderloin to delicious vegetarian options. We also ensure that all food is kosher, under the supervision of the local Jewish community board.  

For pricing, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing for the evening. This price also covers a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests. Please note that VAT is included in this price. However, beverages are not included in this package, but we can provide a bar service upon request.  

I look forward to discussing this further and tailoring our offerings to your needs.  

Best regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your quick response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a couple of details before we proceed. Could you confirm if the $75 per person covers all aspects of the meal, including any appetizers or desserts? Additionally, we are expecting around 120 guests, but there is a possibility that it could go up to 160. Would that affect the pricing?  

Lastly, could you provide some examples of the appetizers and desserts you typically serve? We want to ensure we have a delightful variety for our attendees.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Samantha,  

Thank you for your follow-up questions. The $75 per person does include a full three-course meal, which consists of an appetizer, main course, and dessert. We can certainly accommodate up to 160 guests, and the price remains the same as long as we stay within that number.  

For appetizers, we often serve options like smoked salmon canapés and stuffed mushrooms, while our dessert menu includes items such as mini cheesecakes and chocolate mousse. We also offer gluten-free and vegan options to cater to specific dietary needs.  

Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll prepare a formal agreement for you.

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for the details; they sound fantastic. I would like to confirm our order for 120 guests at the price of $75 per person, which totals to $9,000. Please proceed with preparing the agreement. I assume the cancellation policy allows for changes up to one week before the event?  

Looking forward to working with you to make our gala a success.
