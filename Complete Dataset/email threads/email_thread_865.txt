Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person includes beverages or if that would be an additional cost. Additionally, could you confirm if the menu can be tailored to include a kosher option, particularly under proper supervision?  

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your questions. The $75 per person does not include a bar, but we can offer a beverage package at an additional cost if you’re interested. Regarding kosher options, we can certainly provide a kosher menu supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring all dietary requirements are met.  

If we move forward, I can finalize the menu and pricing to ensure everything aligns with your expectations. Please let me know your thoughts.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

I appreciate your flexibility and the clarification regarding the kosher options. I would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests, which brings the total to $11,250, including VAT. Please prepare a contract that outlines the details, including the cancellation policy of 14 days before the event.  

Thank you for your assistance. Looking forward to working with you!
