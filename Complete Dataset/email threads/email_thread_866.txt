Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming corporate gala on October 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special event.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at $55 per person, which includes a full buffet service. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests and are able to provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options. Additionally, all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets all dietary requirements.  

We also provide an array of beverages, but if you would like a full bar service, we can discuss that as an add-on. Please let me know if you have specific dietary accommodations we should consider.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Michael Green

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed information. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a little. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a lower price per person, perhaps around $50?  

Also, could you clarify if the $55 includes VAT, or will that be an additional charge? We'd like to ensure everything is accounted for as we finalize our budget.

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the budget. While I can offer a discount to $52 per person, this would still provide you with a complete buffet experience, including the mixed menu options and kosher supervision. The price does include VAT, so there won’t be any surprise additional charges.  

If you would like to proceed with the adjusted price, please let me know, and we can move forward with the planning.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to confirm the catering at $52 per person for 120 guests, which totals $6,240. I appreciate that the price includes VAT, and I’m glad to know that you can accommodate our kosher requirements.  

Let’s proceed with the arrangements, including the setup and staffing details. Please send over the contract, and I will review it for any final adjustments.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,
