Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing a delightful dining experience, and I believe our services could enhance your event significantly.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, alongside a variety of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free choices. Our pricing generally starts at $45 per person, which includes setup and staff for the event.  

Please let me know the estimated number of guests, and I would be happy to provide a more detailed proposal, including available menu items.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Jessica Thompson

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting between 100 and 150 guests for the gala. I appreciate the information on the mixed menu and dietary options. Could you clarify whether the $45 per person includes VAT? Also, while we are considering a full service, we are unsure about including a bar with the catering.  

If you could provide a sample menu and confirm these details, that would be very helpful.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. The $45 per person does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. As for the bar, we can provide a full bar service for an extra $15 per person, or you could opt for a beverage package that includes soft drinks and juices at no additional cost.  

In terms of a sample menu, I can suggest items such as herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of gourmet salads. All our food is kosher, under the supervision of the local rabbinical council.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,

Hi Jessica,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to proceed with your catering plan for 125 guests, which would bring the total to $7,125 including VAT but excluding the bar service. Please prepare the final agreement with these details and include the cancellation policy as well.  

Looking forward to working with you.  

Best,  
Sarah
