Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our menu features a selection of gourmet dishes, including grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a variety of vegetarian options. We offer both meat and dairy choices to accommodate different dietary preferences.  

Our pricing starts at $45 per person, and we require a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150 guests. The quoted price includes VAT, and we can also provide kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please note that we do not include a bar service in our standard package, but we can arrange for that at an additional cost.  

If you have any specific dietary accommodations in mind or would like to discuss further details, please let me know. I look forward to working with you to create an enjoyable dining experience for your guests.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed menu options. I appreciate the kosher offerings, as we have several guests who observe dietary laws. Could you confirm if the $45 per person price includes all setup and staffing or if those are additional costs? Also, given our guest count might fluctuate, what is your cancellation policy should we need to adjust the numbers closer to the event?  

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt follow-up. The $45 per person price does include setup and staffing, ensuring everything runs smoothly on the day of the event. As for the cancellation policy, we allow changes to the guest count up to one week before the event, with a full refund available if canceled within 30 days.  

If you could provide an estimated guest count soon, I can reserve the date for you. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further adjustments to the menu.  

Warm regards,
