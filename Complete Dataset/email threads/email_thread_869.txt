Hi Rebecca,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is an important event for us, and I appreciate your flexibility with the menu. I wanted to confirm if the £35 per person rate includes beverages or if we need to arrange that separately. Additionally, could you clarify the kosher status of the food? We have guests who require kosher meals, so I would need to know the supervision details.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Samantha,  

I appreciate your questions. The £35 per person price does not include beverages; we can arrange a bar service at an additional cost. As for the food, all of our menu options can be made kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din. We can easily accommodate your guests' dietary needs, including gluten-free and vegan options.  

If you decide to proceed, we can finalize the details and agree on a cancellation policy that allows for flexibility.  

Best,
