For your gathering, we can provide a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Our pricing structure is set at £25 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 120 guests. Additionally, we offer dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

As for beverages, we typically do not include a bar, but we can discuss options if you’d like to add that. All our food is kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din.

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. Since we’re expecting about 80 guests, the pricing seems reasonable. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit lower, perhaps around £22 per person, given our budget constraints.  

Also, could you send over a sample menu? I’d love to see what specific dishes you offer, especially any signature items. Moreover, regarding the drinks, could you provide a rough estimate for adding a bar service? I want to ensure we have a well-rounded experience for our attendees.  

Looking forward to your thoughts!  

Best,  
Samantha

Hello Samantha,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand your budget concerns, and I can offer the adjusted rate of £22 per person for 80 guests. This brings the total to £1,760, which includes VAT.  

Regarding the bar service, we can offer a selection of wines and soft drinks, which would cost an additional £500. As for the menu, I’ve attached a sample featuring some of our most popular dishes, such as roasted chicken with herbs, grilled vegetable platters, and a variety of desserts.  

Please confirm if this works for you, and we can proceed with the next steps.
