Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding your upcoming wedding reception scheduled for March 15, 2024. We at Gourmet Delights would love the opportunity to cater this special occasion.  

We provide a wide range of menu options, including both meat and dairy dishes, which can be tailored to your preferences. Our pricing structure is flexible, typically ranging from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the final menu selection. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

All our food is prepared under strict rabbinical supervision, ensuring it meets kosher standards. For beverages, we usually recommend a bar package, which can be added to the catering service.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details regarding your catering services. The range you provided seems reasonable, but I would like to know more about what specific dishes can be included within that price range. Additionally, could you clarify if VAT is included in the per-person pricing?  

We are expecting around 100 guests, so it would be helpful to know how your offerings can cater to various dietary restrictions as well. The bar option sounds interesting—could you provide a separate quote for that as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,
