Dear Sarah,

Please let me know how many guests you anticipate, and I can provide a tailored proposal that includes some of our most popular dishes.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. We are expecting between 100 and 150 guests for the gala. I am particularly interested in a mixed menu that includes some kosher options, as we have guests who observe dietary laws. Could you let me know if the kosher meals are under any specific supervision?  

Also, I’d like to clarify if your pricing is fixed, or if there are additional costs for setup and staffing. Including beverages is also important to us, so please confirm if that is part of the package or if it would be an additional expense.  

I appreciate your help in getting this sorted.  

Best,  
Sarah Thompson

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for the details about your guest count. We can certainly provide a mixed menu, with kosher options supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our fixed price is set at 70 dollars per person, which includes setup and staffing. However, beverages would be an additional cost, with options ranging from a selection of wines to soft drinks.  

If you choose to proceed, I can finalize the offer for 10,500 dollars for 150 guests, which includes VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for changes up to ten days before the event without penalty.  

Let me know how you would like to move forward.  

Best,
