Dear Hannah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your event on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering for corporate events and celebrations. Our offerings include a diverse range of menu options, and we take pride in accommodating various dietary needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, with a focus on seasonal ingredients. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

We also provide kosher options under the supervision of the Star-K organization, ensuring all requirements are met. As for beverages, we offer a range of packages, including a full bar or non-alcoholic options, depending on your preference.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific requirements in mind.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds appealing. However, I would like to clarify a few details. We are anticipating around 100 guests, but there may be some fluctuations. Would it be possible to lower the price per person to $40? Additionally, while I appreciate the kosher options, we will need to confirm if the bar service can be included at this price.  

Could you also provide some specific menu highlights? It would be great to see some examples of what you can offer.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Hannah,  

Thank you for your response. I understand your concerns regarding pricing. While we typically maintain the $45 per person rate, I can offer you a fixed price of $4,000 for 100 guests, which covers the mixed menu along with kosher certification under Star-K. Unfortunately, we would need to add the bar service separately at an additional cost of $1,200.  

As for the menu, we can offer dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platter, and a selection of gourmet salads. We are also happy to accommodate vegan and gluten-free options upon request.  

Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your updated proposal. I appreciate your willingness to provide the fixed price for 100 guests, and the menu options sound delicious. I would like to proceed with the agreement for the $4,000 catering service, excluding the bar for now. Please confirm that the cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to one week before the event.  

Once confirmed, we can discuss the next steps.  

Best regards,
