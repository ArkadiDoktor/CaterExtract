Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming charity gala scheduled for November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at £45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring a selection of meats and vegetarian options. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. This price includes VAT, and we can also provide kosher options under the supervision of the London Beth Din.  

Additionally, we can offer a drinks package that includes a selection of wines and soft drinks, but please note that if you'd prefer a full bar service, that would be at an additional cost. We pride ourselves on our ability to cater to various dietary needs, so please let us know if there are any specific requirements.  

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate it a bit further since we have a limited budget for the charity gala. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to £40 per person?  

Also, could you confirm if the menu will feature any vegetarian dishes? It's important for us to cater to all our guests. Lastly, could you clarify the cancellation policy in case of any unforeseen changes?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the constraints of a charity event. I can offer a revised rate of £42 per person if we proceed with the menu I proposed. The menu will indeed include vegetarian options to ensure all dietary preferences are catered to.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a minimum of two weeks' notice for any changes to the guest count or cancellation, after which a fee may apply. I hope this works for you, and I'm excited to be part of such a wonderful cause.  

Best,
