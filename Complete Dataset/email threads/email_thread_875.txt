Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We are excited about the opportunity to cater for your event and would be happy to provide a selection of our menu options.  

For a gathering of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu, including a variety of meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing is set at £50 per person, which includes a two-course meal and dessert. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and all prices include VAT.   

I’d like to confirm that we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din. Additionally, we can offer beverage services, but please let me know if you would like to include a full bar or just soft drinks.  

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and any specific dietary requirements you might have.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed price and the details sound good, but I would like to clarify a couple of points. We are expecting around 120 guests, and I want to confirm that the £50 per person covers everything, including dessert.  

Also, can you provide more details on the dietary accommodations you can offer? Some of our guests have specific needs, and I want to ensure we can cater to them. Lastly, is there any flexibility in pricing if we decide on a larger number of guests?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The £50 per person indeed includes the two-course meal and dessert, and we can provide a range of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian, gluten-free, and nut-free options.  

Regarding pricing, if you choose to increase the guest count to 150, I can offer a reduced rate of £45 per person. As for our cancellation policy, we require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund of your deposit.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and if you have any specific dishes in mind for the menu.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarification. I’m pleased to accept your offer of £45 per person for 150 guests. Please proceed with the arrangements for the mixed menu, including the dietary options we discussed. I’m also happy to confirm that we will only require soft drinks for beverages.  

Let’s ensure that all arrangements, including setup and staffing, are finalized in the next couple of weeks, especially since our event date is quickly approaching.  

Looking forward to working together!
