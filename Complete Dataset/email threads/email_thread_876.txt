Dear Hannah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We're excited about the opportunity to cater for your event. We offer a range of menu options, including both meat and dairy dishes, as well as several vegetarian and vegan options to accommodate various dietary preferences.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at a fixed rate of $75 per person, and this includes the setup and service staff. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. The quoted price includes VAT. Additionally, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Kashrut Authority, ensuring it meets high standards.  

Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu, and feel free to ask about any specific requirements you may have.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed price of $75 per person seems reasonable, but I was hoping to explore the possibility of adjusting it slightly, as we have a tight budget. Would you be able to offer a lower price if we increase the number of guests to 120?  

Also, could you confirm if beverages are included in the package or if we need to arrange those separately? I'm looking for a mixed menu that includes some popular options, perhaps your signature brisket and a few vegetarian dishes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Hannah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the budget constraints. If we increase the guest count to 120, I can offer a revised price of $70 per person. However, please note that beverages, including a bar, are not included in this price and would need to be arranged separately.  

For the menu, I can certainly include our popular brisket along with a selection of vegetarian options, such as roasted vegetable pasta and a fresh garden salad. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
