Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Catering for your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for December 15th. We specialize in providing exceptional dining experiences for events like yours.  

For your event, I recommend a mixed menu featuring options such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a full three-course meal and setup. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards. Please note that beverages are not included in the pricing, but we can provide a bar service at an additional cost.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss the menu further or if you have any questions.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Cohen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I believe it would suit our guests well. I wanted to clarify whether the $75 price per person includes VAT or if that is an additional charge. Also, we might have a few guests with dietary restrictions, and I'd like to know what accommodations you can provide for them.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person pricing does include VAT, so there won't be any surprises there. Regarding dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request. If you have specific needs, please let me know, and we can tailor the menu accordingly.  

I understand you are still finalizing the guest list. If you confirm the final number of guests, we can hold that pricing for you. I can also offer a package that includes a bar for an additional $20 per person.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I appreciate you confirming the VAT inclusion and the dietary accommodations. After discussing with the team, we would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests, including the bar option, which brings the total to $7,500. I will send over a deposit to secure the booking. Please also confirm the cancellation policy at your earliest convenience.  

Looking forward to working together.
