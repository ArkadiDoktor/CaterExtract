Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to various dietary needs and preferences. Our menu options typically include a mixed selection of meat and dairy dishes, along with pareve options.  

For your event, we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can also provide beverage service, but this would be at an additional cost, if you’re interested.  

If you have any specific requests or dietary requirements, please let me know, and I would be happy to assist further.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. The guest count is likely to be around 100, so your pricing seems reasonable. However, I wanted to clarify whether your menu can cater to some vegan preferences as well. Also, could you confirm if the kosher supervision is under a recognized authority?  

Regarding the beverages, what would the additional charges look like? I want to ensure everything fits within our budget.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. We can certainly accommodate vegan options alongside our standard menu. Our kosher meals are supervised by the Orthodox Union, which should meet your requirements.  

As for the beverages, we typically charge an additional $15 per person for a full bar service, which includes wine, beer, and soft drinks. If you prefer a more tailored beverage package, we can discuss that as well.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

I appreciate the vegan options and the kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union. Please include the beverage package for an additional $1,500, bringing our total to $6,000.  

Additionally, I would like to confirm that your cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks in advance. Once I receive the formal agreement, I will sign and return it promptly.
