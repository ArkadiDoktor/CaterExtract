Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming corporate gala on October 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to assist you with this event.  

For your gala, we can offer a mixed menu that includes options such as grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a variety of vegetarian dishes. Our pricing structure is $65 per person for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. This rate includes VAT. However, please note that beverages are not included in this price.  

Additionally, we can accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options. Our food is kosher, supervised by the local Kashrut authority.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any specific requirements in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu options sound fantastic, and I appreciate the inclusion of dietary accommodations. However, our guest count may reach closer to 200, and I’d like to understand the potential pricing adjustments for that number. Could you also clarify if the $65 per person price is fixed or negotiable?  

I’m also interested in knowing more about the cancellation policy and whether staffing for the event is included in that price.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. For a guest count of 200, the price would adjust to $60 per person if you confirm the booking by the end of this week. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to two weeks before the event, after which we retain a 25% deposit.  

Staffing for your event is included in the per-person price, ensuring that your guests receive attentive service throughout the evening. Please let me know if this works for you, and I’d be happy to finalize the details.  

Best regards,

I appreciate the adjustments you've made to the proposal. The $60 per person for 200 guests works for us, and I am glad to hear about the staffing inclusion. Please consider this email as confirmation for the catering services for our gala on October 15th.  

Could you send over the final contract for our records?  

Thank you for your assistance.
