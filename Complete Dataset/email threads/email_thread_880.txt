Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming conference on March 15th at the Downtown Convention Center. We would be delighted to assist you in providing a memorable dining experience for your attendees.  

We can offer a mixed menu, featuring both meat and vegetarian options. Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate between 100 to 300 guests, and all food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can include a selection of beverages for an extra $10 per person. Please note that prices are exclusive of VAT.  

I would be happy to discuss your specific requirements and provide a tailored proposal. Let me know a convenient time for you.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details you provided. I appreciate the mixed menu and the kosher certification. However, I was hoping to keep the budget a bit lower. Would it be possible to adjust the pricing to around $40 per person? Additionally, can you confirm if the beverages are included in that price or if they are separate?  

I look forward to your feedback as we finalize the arrangements for the conference.

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the budget constraints. We can indeed reduce the price to $40 per person if we adjust the menu offerings slightly. The beverages would still be an additional $10 per person, so the total would be $50 if included. Please remember that the final price will also be subject to VAT.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the details, including the menu items and dietary accommodations.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your willingness to adjust the pricing. I agree to your offer of $40 per person for the catering, with the additional $10 for beverages, bringing the total to $50 per person. Please confirm that VAT is included in this price. I would also like to proceed with the arrangement for 150 guests and would appreciate a list of the proposed menu items and any dietary accommodations you can provide.  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can finalize everything.
