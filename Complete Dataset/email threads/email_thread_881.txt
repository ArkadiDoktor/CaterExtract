Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to various events, and I would love to discuss how we can best serve your needs. 

For this event, we offer a mixed menu that includes options suitable for various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free choices. Our pricing is structured at $50 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests, and our prices are inclusive of VAT. 

Additionally, I want to mention that all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. However, we do not include a bar in our standard package. I suggest we set a time to discuss the menu options further.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I wanted to inquire if you can offer any flexibility in the pricing, as our budget is a bit tight. Could you possibly accommodate a lower price per person if we decide to go with 150 guests? 

Also, could you clarify if there are any additional fees for dietary accommodations? Lastly, can you provide a few examples of the menu items you would suggest for the gala?

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I understand the need for budget considerations, and I can offer a revised price of $45 per person if you confirm 150 guests. This price still includes setup and staffing, along with the VAT. 

As for dietary accommodations, we can certainly provide options at no additional charge, such as vegan dishes or gluten-free meals. For the menu, I would recommend items like herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a variety of salads, which have been popular at previous events.

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.

Best regards,
