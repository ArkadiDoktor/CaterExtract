Dear Emily,  

Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to your specific needs.  

For your event, I recommend our mixed menu, which features a variety of delicious options that can accommodate different dietary preferences. Our signature dishes include herb-roasted chicken, roasted vegetable quinoa salad, and a selection of gourmet desserts.  

We typically charge a fixed price of $55 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. I would also like to mention that our meals are kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or if you would like to discuss beverage options, as they are not included in the base price.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds appealing, but I would like to clarify a few points before we proceed.  

Could you confirm if the $55 per person includes everything, or are there additional charges for setup and staffing? We also have a guest list that may range from 70 to 120 people. Additionally, we would like to know if you can accommodate vegan options, as some of our attendees have dietary restrictions.  

Lastly, could you provide information regarding your cancellation policy?  

Thanks,

Dear Emily,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that the $55 per person indeed covers setup and staffing, ensuring a seamless experience for you and your guests. We can accommodate a range of dietary options, including vegan dishes, at no additional cost.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, you can cancel up to five days before the event without incurring any fees. After that, a 50% charge will apply if you need to cancel.  

If you confirm a final guest count, we can lock in the pricing and finalize the details.  

Best,
