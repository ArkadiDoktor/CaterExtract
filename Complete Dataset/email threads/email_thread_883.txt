We typically charge $45 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing for the event. We recommend a minimum of 50 guests to ensure an enjoyable experience, with a maximum of 150 guests. Our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and I can confirm that all meals will be kosher.

Hi David,  

I appreciate your prompt response and the detailed information. The menu options sound great, but I wanted to clarify a couple of points. Is your $45 per person price inclusive of VAT? Also, while we are considering a full bar, I’m curious if you could provide a separate quote for beverages.  

Additionally, could you share a few examples of the menu items you typically serve? We may have a few guests with dietary restrictions that we should accommodate.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person does not include VAT; that will be added to the final invoice. Regarding beverages, we can provide a bar package for an additional $20 per person, or we can offer a quote for individual drink options if preferred.  

As for the menu, we typically offer options such as herb-roasted chicken, a selection of vegetarian pasta dishes, and a variety of fresh salads. We can also accommodate gluten-free and dairy-free requests upon advance notice.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations, and I will prepare a revised proposal for your review.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at the $45 per person rate, plus the bar package for an additional $20 per person. This brings the total to $6,500, including VAT. I appreciate your flexibility regarding dietary accommodations as well.  

Could you please confirm the cancellation policy and any specific timing you need for setup on the day of the event? I am looking forward to working together to make this gala a success!  

Best regards,
