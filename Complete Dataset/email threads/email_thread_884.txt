Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Catering Co. regarding your upcoming wedding celebration scheduled for April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to your needs.  

For your event, we offer a mixed menu featuring an array of dishes, including grilled chicken, vegetarian options, and gourmet salads. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

Additionally, we ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised under the OK certification. Please note that beverages and bar services are not included in this pricing but can be arranged separately.  

I would be happy to discuss this further and provide a detailed menu if you're interested.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the initial details. The mixed menu sounds great, and I'm glad to hear that the food is kosher. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Would it be possible to adjust the per person rate to accommodate a larger guest list? We are expecting around 120 guests.  

Also, could you clarify whether the $75 per person includes any dietary accommodations for guests with allergies or specific needs?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I appreciate your interest in adjusting the guest count. We can definitely offer a price of $70 per person if you confirm the 120 guests. We can also accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian options, at no additional cost.  

Please remember that the cancellation policy requires a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event. If you’re ready to proceed, I can send over a formal agreement outlining all the details.  

Best wishes,
