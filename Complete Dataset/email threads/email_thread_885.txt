Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on March 15th at the downtown conference center. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this occasion. Our team specializes in a variety of menu options, including meat and dairy dishes, ensuring we can accommodate your preferences.

For an event of this nature, we typically suggest a fixed price of $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Our pricing includes VAT, and we can confirm that all food will be prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.

Please let me know if you have any specific menu items in mind, or if you would like us to suggest some popular options. We also offer beverage packages, but this is separate from the catering fees.

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi David,

Thank you for your detailed proposal. I appreciate the information about the kosher supervision. Could you let me know if you have options for dietary accommodations? We might have a few guests who require vegetarian meals. 

Regarding the pricing, is there any flexibility if we were to increase the number of guests? We are considering a range between 80 and 120 attendees. 

Lastly, could you clarify if the beverage package is included in the per person price you mentioned? 

Thanks again for your help.

Best,

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your response. We can certainly accommodate vegetarian meals and can provide a variety of options to suit your guests' needs. 

As for the pricing, we can adjust the per person rate slightly if you are looking at a larger group. For 80 guests, the price remains at $45 per person, but if you're looking at 120 guests, we could reduce it to $42 per person. 

The beverage package is not included in the initial price; it is an additional $10 per person. This package includes non-alcoholic beverages and a selection of wines. 

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Best,

Hi David,

Thank you for your quick response and for clarifying the pricing and beverage options. I would like to confirm the catering for 120 guests at the rate of $42 per person, which includes the vegetarian options. We will also add the beverage package for an additional $10 per person. 

This brings the total to $6,240, and I understand that this includes VAT. Please send over the contract along with the cancellation policy for our records. 

Looking forward to working together!
