Dear Sandra,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to be a part of your event. 

We can offer a mixed menu that includes options for both meat and dairy, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K. Our pricing structure is flexible, starting at $45 per person, which includes a full buffet service. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests, and we can serve up to 150 guests if needed. Please let me know if you would like to include beverages, as they are not part of our standard package. 

If you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, I would be happy to discuss those as well.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Reynolds

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if the $45 includes VAT, and if you can offer a few more vegetarian options for our guests. Also, could you confirm whether the bar service is available?  

Let me know your thoughts, as I want to ensure we have everything lined up for 75 guests.  

Best,

Hi Sandra,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 price does not include VAT, which will be added on top. I can certainly include additional vegetarian options in the menu, such as stuffed peppers and a gourmet pasta dish. As for the bar, we do offer a range of beverage packages that can be added to your order. 

For 75 guests, the total would come to $3,375, including the additional vegetarian options but excluding the beverages. Please also note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if cancelled at least two weeks prior to the event date.  

Let me know if this works for you.  

Best,
