Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. We are expecting between 100 and 150 guests for the conference. I’m interested in a mixed menu that accommodates various dietary restrictions, including vegetarian options. Can you provide a more specific price based on the minimum expected attendees? Additionally, are beverages included, or would they be an extra charge?  

I appreciate your attention to detail and look forward to your proposal.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. Based on your expected guest count, I can offer a fixed price of $4,500 for 100 guests, which would cover a diverse mixed menu with options for vegetarians and gluten-free meals as well. Beverages would be an additional cost, starting at $2,000 for a standard bar setup. Please note that all prices include VAT.  

If you have any specific dishes in mind, I can tailor the menu further. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks before the event. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best regards,
