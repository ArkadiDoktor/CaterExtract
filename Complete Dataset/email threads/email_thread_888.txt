Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on March 15th. We specialize in providing exceptional catering services for such events, and I would love to assist you.  

For this particular gathering, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options to cater to various preferences. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests, ensuring that everyone has a delightful dining experience.  

Our menu can include options like grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and assorted desserts. We also have the ability to accommodate specific dietary restrictions upon request. Please let me know if you would like to include a bar service, which we can arrange for an additional cost.  

Looking forward to your response so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi Laura,  

Thank you for your quick response. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the details you provided. However, I would like to clarify a couple of points before proceeding.  

Is the $45 per person the final price, or are there additional costs associated with setup and staffing? Also, we are considering a guest list that might reach up to 175 attendees. Would you be able to accommodate that, and if so, would the pricing change? Lastly, can you confirm whether the food is kosher and if there are specific supervision details?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,  
Rachel

Hi Rachel,  

Thanks for your follow-up. The $45 per person does include setup and staffing for the minimum of 50 guests, but for numbers beyond that, we would need to adjust the final price accordingly. For 175 guests, the price would increase to $42 per person, still inclusive of VAT.  

Regarding kosher certification, all our food is kosher and is supervised by the Orthodox Union. We can certainly accommodate your guest list and ensure that dietary restrictions are met, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. As for the bar service, it can be arranged at an additional $15 per person if you decide to include it.  

Let me know if you would like to proceed with this updated proposal.  

Best,

Hi Laura,  

Thank you for the clarification on the pricing and kosher supervision. I appreciate your flexibility with the guest count. I would like to confirm the catering for 175 guests at the price of $42 per person, totaling $7,350, which includes VAT and setup. We will not require the bar service, but please ensure that all dietary options are clearly labeled.  

Regarding cancellation, I would like to understand your policy in case we need to make changes closer to the date. Once I have that information, I will provide a deposit to secure our booking.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,
