Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Rosen, and I am with Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand you are organizing a large corporate event on October 15, and I would love to provide our catering services.  

We specialize in a variety of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council. Our pricing typically runs around $45 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests for this event. Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or any dietary needs you might have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The event is indeed on October 15, and we are expecting around 100 guests. I appreciate the price per person you mentioned, but we were hoping to keep the budget closer to $40 per person. Could you let me know if there’s flexibility in your pricing? Also, can you confirm if that includes VAT?  

We also need to ensure that the menu can accommodate vegetarian options, as some of our guests have dietary restrictions.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for clarifying your budget. I can offer a revised menu that would fit within your $40 per person request. This would still include a variety of options such as grilled vegetable skewers, a choice of chicken or fish as the main course, alongside a delicious dessert selection.  

Regarding VAT, the price I quoted does include it, so there won't be any additional charges. I can also ensure we have vegetarian and gluten-free options available to accommodate your guests’ needs.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility and quick reply. I am happy to proceed with the $40 per person quote including VAT for 100 guests, which brings the total to $4,000. Please include a selection of kosher options, and let’s ensure that vegetarian and gluten-free dishes are part of the offerings.  

I’ll also need confirmation on your cancellation policy and any additional setup requirements you may have. Once I receive that, we can move forward.  

Best regards,
