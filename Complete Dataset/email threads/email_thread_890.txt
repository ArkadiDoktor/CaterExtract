Hi Rachel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the initial details. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but I would like to confirm the exact items included, particularly if you could add a few more vegetarian options for some of our guests. Additionally, is there any flexibility on the pricing if we exceed the minimum guest count?  

Lastly, could you clarify the cancellation policy? It’s crucial for us to understand this as we finalize our plans.  

Thank you for your assistance!

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. We can certainly add a few more vegetarian options, such as a quinoa salad and stuffed bell peppers, to accommodate your guests. Regarding the pricing, we can offer a fixed rate of $70 per person if you confirm over 100 guests.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 30 days prior to the event for a full refund. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.
