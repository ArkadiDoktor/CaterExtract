Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming wedding on May 15th. At Taste of Tradition, we specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and we would love to be a part of your special day.  

We offer a diverse menu with a focus on kosher cuisine, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal with options for meat, dairy, and pareve dishes. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and all prices include VAT.  

Please let me know if you are interested, and I can provide you with a sample menu and discuss any dietary needs you might have.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Rosen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details. I appreciate the kosher supervision, as it is essential for our event. However, I was hoping to get a more detailed breakdown of the menu options available, particularly for vegetarian guests, as we might have a few attending.  

Additionally, could you confirm if beverages are included in the $75 price per person? We are expecting around 120 guests, so if you could provide a fixed price for that number, it would help us finalize our budget.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I completely understand the need for vegetarian options, and we can certainly accommodate that with dishes such as stuffed bell peppers and a seasonal vegetable platter. As for beverages, we typically do not include the bar in our standard pricing, but we can offer a beverage package for an additional $15 per person.  

For 120 guests, the total would come to $9,000, which includes VAT and the three-course meal. If you decide to go with the beverage package, that would be an additional $1,800, bringing the total to $10,800. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if cancelled 30 days prior to the event.  

Let me know your thoughts, and I can send over the detailed menu options.  

Best,
