Dear Lisa,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Fresh Bites Catering for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We specialize in providing delicious and high-quality meals tailored to any occasion.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu, featuring options like grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. Our pricing starts from $40 per person, which includes setup and service staff. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests.  

All our meals can be prepared kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, if that's a requirement for you. Please note that beverages are not included in the base package but can be arranged at an additional cost.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific dietary requirements we should consider.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the menu options. I appreciate that you can cater to our kosher requirements. However, the pricing seems a bit higher than what we had initially budgeted. Is there any flexibility on the $40 per person rate? We are expecting around 100 guests, and I want to ensure we stay within our budget while still providing a great experience.  

Also, could you clarify if that price includes VAT? We would also need some gluten-free options available for a few attendees.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Lisa,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of sticking to a budget. While the standard rate is $40 per person, I can offer a revised price of $35 per person if we can finalize the details soon. This price would include VAT.  

Regarding dietary options, we can certainly provide gluten-free meals along with the standard menu. If we can proceed with this arrangement, I will ensure that all necessary accommodations are made.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,
