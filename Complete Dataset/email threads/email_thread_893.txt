Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in creating exquisite culinary experiences and would be delighted to assist you.  

For an event of this nature, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options to cater to a diverse range of tastes. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and this price includes VAT. If you require any dietary accommodations, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options, please let us know.  

As for the supervision, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Kosher Certification Authority. Please also note that our package does not include a bar service, but we can assist in organizing beverages separately if needed.  

I look forward to discussing this further with you.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. The mixed menu sounds great, but I would like to clarify a few points. Given our budget constraints, could we explore a lower price point, perhaps around $65 per person? Additionally, we anticipate around 100 guests and would appreciate if you could provide a list of representative dishes included in the menu.  

Also, could you confirm if the VAT is included in your initial pricing? Lastly, I would like to know what your cancellation policy is in case of unforeseen circumstances.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your response and for providing clarity on your budget. We can adjust the price to $65 per person for a minimum of 80 guests. The menu would still feature a variety of options, including grilled chicken skewers, stuffed mushrooms, and a hearty vegetable lasagna, along with assorted desserts.  

To confirm, the $65 includes VAT. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to two weeks before the event date. After that, we can offer a 50% refund if cancellation occurs within a week of the event.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you.  

Best,
