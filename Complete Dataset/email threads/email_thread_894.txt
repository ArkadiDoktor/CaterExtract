Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We specialize in a range of catering options and can tailor our services to suit your specific needs.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy dishes, ensuring that we can accommodate most dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes all food items, setup, and staffing for the day. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests. Additionally, our meals are under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, so you can be assured of the highest standards.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but I would like to clarify whether the $45 per person price includes VAT or if it will be added on top. Additionally, can you confirm if beverages are included in that price or if they are an extra cost?  

We are expecting around 120 guests, and I want to ensure everything is clear before finalizing our arrangements. If we proceed, I’d also appreciate knowing more about the cancellation terms.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The price of $45 per person does not include VAT, which will be added to the final invoice. As for beverages, we can provide a bar service at an additional cost or you can choose to handle the drinks independently.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we ask for a minimum of 14 days' notice for any cancellations, which would incur a 50% charge of the total estimated cost.  

If you would like to proceed with 120 guests, your total would come to $5,400, including staffing and setup. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you are ready to confirm.  

Best,  
David
