Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to follow up on our recent conversation regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on April 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this event.  

Our catering packages start at $65 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150, ensuring a delightful experience for all attendees. Additionally, all our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can offer a mixed menu that caters to various dietary needs, including vegetarian options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there are specific menu items you have in mind.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $65 per person rate sounds reasonable, but given our budget constraints, could you possibly offer a more competitive price? We are particularly interested in ensuring that there are robust options for both meat and vegetarian dishes.  

Additionally, could you clarify if the pricing includes VAT? I would also like to know if beverages will be part of the package or if they are charged separately.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the importance of staying within budget. I can offer you a revised price of $60 per person, with VAT included. This price will cover a variety of dishes—meat and vegetarian—along with a selection of desserts. As for the beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our standard package; however, I can provide a quote for a beverage service if you're interested.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the menu options.  

Best wishes,
