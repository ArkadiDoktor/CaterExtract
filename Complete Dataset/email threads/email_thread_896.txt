Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming corporate event scheduled for April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to your specific needs.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring an array of meat and vegetarian options, with a selection of dishes such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and gourmet salads. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes all necessary setup and staffing. This price covers a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests.  

We also ensure that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK Kosher certification. Please note that beverages are not included in this pricing but we can offer a separate bar package if desired.  

I look forward to your feedback and any specific dietary requirements you may have.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I would like to discuss the pricing a bit more, as we have a budget cap for this event. Would you be open to adjusting the price to $40 per person if we can confirm a minimum of 75 guests? Additionally, can you clarify if the quoted price includes VAT?  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,
