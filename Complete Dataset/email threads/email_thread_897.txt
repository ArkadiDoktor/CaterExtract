Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to cater this event for you. Our menu typically features a range of options that include both meat and dairy dishes, allowing for a diverse selection that can cater to various dietary needs.  

For your event, we suggest a fixed price of $75 per person, which covers a three-course meal, including appetizers, a main course, and dessert. This price is applicable for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 200 guests. We also ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised by the Vaad of New York, and we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as well.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu items in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the detailed proposal. The price per person sounds reasonable; however, I would like to know if beverages are included in that price or if they would come at an additional cost. Also, I’m considering a range of 75 to 150 guests, depending on final confirmations. I appreciate the kosher certification and the dietary accommodations.  

Could we possibly adjust the final pricing if we secure a larger number of attendees?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest in our services. Regarding beverages, they are not included in the initial price. We can offer a fully stocked bar or a selection of non-alcoholic beverages at an additional cost. If you expect to have around 150 guests, we could lower the per-person price to $70.  

Please confirm if that works for you, and we can finalize the menu options and any specific requests you may have.  

Best,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the pricing and for clarifying the beverage options. The adjusted price of $70 per person for 150 guests is acceptable. I would like to proceed with this arrangement. Please ensure that the menu includes some of your signature dishes, especially the herb-crusted chicken and the chocolate mousse.  

I understand the cancellation policy is 14 days before the event; that works for us. Please confirm that the final price includes VAT. I look forward to working together to make this event a success.  

Best,
