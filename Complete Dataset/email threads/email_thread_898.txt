Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on February 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our catering options include a diverse menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we typically recommend a range of menu options that can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. Our pricing structure is set at a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes the main course, sides, and desserts. Please note that our prices do not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

In addition, we can provide a selection of non-alcoholic beverages, though a full bar service would be an additional cost. We are more than happy to discuss any dietary needs your guests might have to ensure everyone is catered for.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $75 per person rate sounds reasonable, but I would like to confirm if the VAT is included in that price. Additionally, we are expecting around 100 guests, so could you clarify what your cancellation policy entails?  

Also, while I appreciate the kosher offerings, could you provide more details about the menu options? I want to ensure we cater to different dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. To clarify, the $75 price does not include VAT, which will be calculated at the time of billing. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks before the event.  

Regarding the menu, we can offer a mixed menu with options like herb-roasted chicken, quinoa salad, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We are also equipped to provide vegetarian and gluten-free dishes, ensuring that all dietary needs are met.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the arrangements or if there are any other questions I can help with.  

Warm regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the clarification on pricing and the cancellation policy. I appreciate the detailed menu options as well. I’d like to confirm the catering for 100 guests, so that brings the total to $7,500 plus VAT. Please go ahead and finalize the arrangements. I will ensure the deposit is sent over by the end of the week.  

Looking forward to working with you!  

Best,
