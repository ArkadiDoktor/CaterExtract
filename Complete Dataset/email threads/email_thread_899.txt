Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss catering options for your upcoming wedding on May 15, 2024. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher meals and would love to be part of your special day.  

Our pricing structure is flexible, starting at $75 per person, which includes a variety of dishes tailored to your preferences. We typically cater for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Our meals are prepared under strict rabbinical supervision, ensuring they meet kosher standards.  

In addition to the meal, we can offer a selection of beverages, though this would be at an additional cost. We pride ourselves on our diverse menu, which includes options such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a vegetarian pasta dish.  

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a call to discuss this further.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. I appreciate your flexibility with the pricing and the variety of dishes offered. We are expecting around 100 guests, and I want to confirm that the $75 per person includes VAT, correct?  

Additionally, could you provide more details about the vegetarian options and any dietary accommodations available for guests with allergies? I am also interested in knowing if there are any cancellation policies we should be aware of.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Yes, the $75 per person pricing does indeed include VAT. For vegetarian options, we offer dishes such as roasted vegetable skewers and a delicious quinoa salad. We can also accommodate specific dietary needs, including gluten-free and nut-free options.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 30 days prior to the event for a full refund of any deposits made.  

If you are ready to proceed, I can finalize the count for 100 guests at a total of $7,500. Please let me know your thoughts.
