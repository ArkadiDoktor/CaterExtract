Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the catering services for your upcoming corporate gala on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food for events like yours, and I believe we can create a delightful menu for your guests.  

Our pricing starts at $45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options such as roasted chicken, seasonal vegetables, and a selection of desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. Additionally, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Star-K.  

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further or if you have any specific dietary requirements. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. The menu sounds promising, but I was wondering if you could adjust the pricing a bit. We are aiming for a budget closer to $40 per person, if possible. Also, can you clarify whether the $45 includes VAT?  

Additionally, we will need to know if a bar service is included in this price or if it would be an additional charge. We expect around 150 attendees, and I would appreciate any options you can provide for dietary accommodations as well.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can indeed adjust the pricing to $40 per person, and that will include VAT. However, please note that bar service would be an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of beers, wines, and soft drinks.  

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options without any issue. I hope this works for your event, and I can finalize the menu details once we confirm the guest count.  

Please let me know your thoughts so we can proceed.  

Best,
