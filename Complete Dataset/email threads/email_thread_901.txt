Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the catering proposal. The menu sounds enticing, but I would like to clarify a few details. We expect between 120 to 180 guests, so I appreciate the flexibility. However, could you confirm whether the $50 per person includes beverages or if that would be an additional cost?  

Additionally, we have some guests who require kosher meals. Can you let me know if your offerings are kosher and under what supervision?  

I look forward to your clarification so we can proceed.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I can confirm that our pricing does not include beverages, as we offer a separate bar package if you’re interested. Regarding kosher meals, all of our meat dishes are certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can certainly accommodate those dietary needs.  

With a confirmed guest count of 150, the total for the catering would amount to $7,500, which includes VAT. We can also provide setup and staffing for an additional fee. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Warm regards,
