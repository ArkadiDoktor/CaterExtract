Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming conference on May 15th. We specialize in providing a diverse menu tailored to various dietary needs, and I would love to discuss how we can best serve your guests.  

For events like yours, we typically offer a selection of mixed dishes that include both meat and vegetarian options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, with a minimum requirement of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. This price includes VAT, and we can accommodate kosher dietary needs under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Additionally, we can provide beverages at an extra cost, but our standard package focuses on the meal itself. Please let me know if you have specific menu preferences or any dietary restrictions we should consider.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you provided. Since we are expecting around 120 guests, I wanted to clarify if it would be possible to adjust the menu slightly to include a few more vegetarian options, as we have several attendees with dietary restrictions.  

Also, could you confirm if the $45 per person includes any appetizers or just the main courses? Finally, I would like to know if you can provide some sample dishes for us to review.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best regards,

Hi Rachel,  

I’m glad to hear back from you. We can certainly include more vegetarian options in the menu. The $45 per person covers the main courses, but we can add a selection of appetizers for an additional $10 per person if you're interested.  

I can send over some sample dishes from our previous events, which will include both meat and vegetarian options. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences for the samples, and I’ll make sure to include them.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details soon.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the clarification on the menu options and pricing. I would love to proceed with the package that includes the appetizers for a total cost of $55 per person. We will finalize the guest count at around 120. Please go ahead and prepare the sample dishes, focusing on a good mix including vegetarian options.  

I understand the cancellation policy is flexible up to two weeks before the event, which works for us. Let’s move forward with the agreement.  

Best,
