Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th at the Grandview Hall. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your special day.  

We specialize in a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy options, suitable for diverse tastes. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing for the event. We recommend a minimum of 100 guests and can accommodate up to 200.  

I want to mention that all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We can also provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar will be an additional cost. Naturally, we can cater to various dietary requirements, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Please let me know if you are interested, and I can send over a sample menu.  

Best regards,  
Mark Cohen

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding the catering. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further.  

Is there any flexibility in the per-person rate? We anticipate around 150 guests, but the costs can add up quickly. Additionally, can you confirm whether the quoted price includes VAT?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Jessica Taylor

Hi Jessica,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the pricing. While we typically maintain the rate of $75 per person, I can offer you a revised rate of $70 per person if you confirm your guest count by the end of this week. The quoted price does include VAT, so there will be no additional charges in that regard.  

As for beverages, we can set up a basic bar for an additional $15 per person if you’re interested. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can finalize the menu options right away.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the updated proposal. I appreciate your flexibility with the pricing and for confirming that VAT is included. I would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests at the rate of $70 per person, bringing the total to $10,500.  

Please prepare a menu that highlights some of your best dishes, including options for dietary restrictions, and we can discuss the bar setup in more detail. I’ll also need to understand your cancellation policy.  

Looking forward to finalizing this!  

Best,
