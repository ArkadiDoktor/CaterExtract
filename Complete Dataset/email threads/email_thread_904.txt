Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming charity gala on June 15th at the Grand Ballroom. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Our team specializes in providing a range of menu options, and I can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which generally ranges from $45 to $65, depending on the final menu selection. This price includes VAT, and we can accommodate between 100 to 200 guests. We also have options for dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu preferences in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the range you've provided. Could you clarify if the quoted price includes bar service as well? Additionally, we do need to ensure that all food is kosher. I would like to know the supervision details for that aspect.  

We are leaning towards a selection that highlights our mission, so representative dishes would be helpful to see as well. If we proceed, I would also like to confirm your cancellation policy.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The initial pricing I provided does not include bar service, but we can add a beverage package for an additional cost. As for the kosher requirements, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For your gala, I recommend dishes such as grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a variety of seasonal vegetable platters. Regarding cancellation, we require at least 14 days' notice for a full refund, but we can discuss other options if needed.  

Please let me know if you would like to finalize the details or if you have further questions.  

Best,

Please proceed with the arrangements, and let me know if you need any further details from my end. I look forward to working with you to make this event a success.
