Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming gala on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services, and I would love to discuss how we can assist with your event.  

Our menus feature a variety of options, including meat, dairy, and mixed dishes, and we can accommodate various dietary needs. Our pricing typically ranges from 50 to 75 dollars per person, depending on your selections. We ensure that all our food is kosher and under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Please let me know how many guests you anticipate, and we can start planning a representative menu tailored to your needs.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Hi Elena,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting between 150 to 200 guests for the gala, and I appreciate the information about your kosher options. Could you confirm if the prices include VAT? Also, I would like to know if beverages are included in your pricing.  

I’m particularly interested in a mixed menu with options for dietary restrictions. If you could provide a sample menu with some highlights, that would be great.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. The pricing I mentioned does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the quoted amount. Regarding beverages, we typically do not include a bar in our catering packages, but we can offer a separate beverage service if you’re interested.  

For your event, I can propose a sampling of dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable platters, and a selection of desserts. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions as needed to ensure all your guests are satisfied.  

Please advise if this fits within your budget, and I will prepare a formal quote based on your confirmed guest count.  

Warm regards,  
Elena Martinez

Hi Elena,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. After reviewing our budget, we would like to proceed with your services for 175 guests at a price of 65 dollars per person, which brings us to a total of 11,375 dollars, excluding VAT. We appreciate the mixed menu options and your willingness to accommodate dietary needs.  

Please confirm the arrangement, including setup and staffing for the gala. I understand your cancellation policy is to notify at least a week in advance if needed, which works for us.  

Looking forward to your confirmation.  

Best,
