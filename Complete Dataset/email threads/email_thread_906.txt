Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We are excited about the opportunity to work with you. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a mixed menu that accommodates different dietary preferences. Our pricing is flexible, typically around $40 to $60 per person, depending on the final menu selection.  

We can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union and can certainly accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options as well. As for beverages, we generally do not include a bar in our catering packages but can arrange for a full bar service if you wish.  

Please let me know the estimated number of guests, and I can provide a more specific quote. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt reply. We are expecting between 150 and 200 guests at the gala. I appreciate your flexibility on pricing; however, could you provide a more detailed breakdown of what the $50 per person would include? Also, could you confirm if that price includes VAT?  

Lastly, we are considering a bar service as well, so I'd like to know what options you have available.  

Thanks,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. For the $50 per person, we can provide a three-course meal that includes a choice of beef brisket, herb-roasted chicken, or a vegetarian lasagna, along with appetizers and desserts. This price does include VAT.  

Regarding the bar, we can offer a premium bar package for an additional $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and cocktails. Please advise if this would work for your event, and we can finalize the details.
