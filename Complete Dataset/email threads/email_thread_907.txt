Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on October 15th. We would be thrilled to assist you in making your special day unforgettable.  

Our catering services can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and we offer a menu that features a mix of meat and dairy dishes, all under strict rabbinical supervision, ensuring that everything is kosher. We can provide a variety of options to cater to dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free choices.  

Pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We also offer a selection of beverages, but a full bar would be an additional cost. I will include some sample dishes in our menu, such as herb-roasted chicken, a variety of salads, and delicious desserts.  

Please let me know if you need any further information or if you would like to discuss this in more detail.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm excited about the options you presented. I appreciate that your menu is kosher and that you can accommodate different dietary needs.  

However, I wanted to clarify a couple of things. Could you confirm if the $75 per person price includes the full beverage selection or if there would be additional costs for that? Moreover, we are expecting around 120 guests and would love to see a few more menu items to make our final decision.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest and understand the importance of getting everything just right for your wedding. The $75 per person does include non-alcoholic beverages, but we would charge an additional $15 per person for a full bar service.  

I can certainly provide a few more menu options. How about adding beef brisket, a selection of seasonal vegetables, and a pasta dish to complement the current offerings? Let me know if this works for you or if you have specific items in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for clarifying the beverage options. I appreciate the additional menu suggestions and would like to confirm the catering for 120 guests with the full bar option included, which brings the total to $10,500.  

Please note that we would like to have a cancellation policy that allows us to cancel with a full refund if necessary, up to 30 days before the event date.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details with you.  

Best,
