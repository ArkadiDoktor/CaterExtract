Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our menu options feature a range of delicious dishes, including gourmet appetizers, main courses, and desserts, all designed to impress your guests.  

We typically charge $60 per person for a mixed menu, which includes a selection of meat and vegetarian options. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that our pricing includes VAT and we can provide kosher meals supervised by the OK.  

For beverages, we offer separate bar packages if you are interested, as they are not included in the base catering price. If you have specific dietary requirements, we can certainly accommodate them, so please let me know what you need.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best,  
Michael

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the quick response. The menu sounds fantastic, but I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit more. Given our budget constraints, would you consider reducing the price to $50 per person? Additionally, could you clarify what specific dietary options are available?  

I also want to ensure that we have sufficient time for setup on the event day. What does your staffing situation look like?  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best regards,  
Rachel
