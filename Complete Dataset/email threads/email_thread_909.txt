Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Gatherings regarding your upcoming conference on April 15th. We specialize in catering events of this nature and would be delighted to provide our services.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of appetizers, mains, and desserts. The pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. Our services can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests, and we can also provide dietary accommodations upon request.  

If you would like, I can send over a sample menu along with details on our kosher supervision, which is under the authority of the local rabbinical council. Please let me know if you would like any specific beverages included in the package or if you prefer to arrange that separately.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed menu sounds appealing, and the pricing seems reasonable. However, I wanted to clarify the inclusion of beverages. Are drinks part of the $45 per person rate, or are they charged separately? Additionally, could you confirm whether the menu can be adjusted for a couple of vegan guests?  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to finalizing the details soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person pricing does not include beverages; we can provide a selection of drinks for an additional cost, or you can choose to bring your own. As for dietary needs, we can absolutely accommodate vegan options within the proposed menu.  

I hope this helps, and I am happy to send over a detailed menu for your review. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the booking.  

Best,
