Dear Claire,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our catering can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and we offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person cost of 75 dollars, which includes VAT. We can also provide a selection of beverages, though please note that a bar service is available at an additional cost. We are capable of providing kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

If you have specific dietary requirements, please let us know, and we will do our best to accommodate them. Additionally, we handle all the setup and staffing needs for the event, ensuring everything runs smoothly.  

I look forward to hearing back from you so we can finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the flexibility in menu options. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing further. Given our budget constraints, would it be possible to reduce the per-person price to 65 dollars? Additionally, could you clarify whether the pricing includes all staffing costs or if those are extra?  

Also, while I understand that a bar service comes at an additional charge, I would like to know what beverage options you typically provide for events like ours.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Claire,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the budget. While we typically maintain the per-person cost at 75 dollars, I can offer a discounted rate of 70 dollars per person if we can secure a minimum of 100 guests. This price would still include all staffing and setup costs.  

As for the beverage options, we usually provide a selection of wines, soft drinks, and water, with the possibility of upgrading to a full bar for an additional fee. Please let me know if this adjusted proposal works for you, and we can proceed with the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your revised offer. I can agree to the 70 dollars per person for 100 guests, which totals 7,000 dollars. This includes the VAT, correct? I also appreciate the clarity on the beverage options, and I think we can proceed without the bar for this event.  

Please confirm that the menu will be kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision and that we will have accommodations for dietary restrictions as needed. I look forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the contract.  

Best regards,
