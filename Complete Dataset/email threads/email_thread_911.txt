Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the catering for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in providing exceptional food services for events like yours, and I would be thrilled to assist you.  

For the gala, we recommend a buffet-style menu featuring a range of dishes, including grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and assorted salads. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing starts at $45 per person, inclusive of VAT. We also offer a selection of desserts and can provide a kosher option under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council of America.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific dietary needs or any other requirements you might have.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply and for the initial proposal. The menu sounds great, especially the grilled chicken and roasted vegetables. I appreciate the kosher options as well.  

Before we proceed, I would like to confirm a couple of details. Would you be able to provide a few more dessert options? Additionally, I am wondering if the $45 per person includes beverages or if they are priced separately. Lastly, could you clarify your cancellation policy?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I’m glad you liked the menu. For desserts, we can offer options such as chocolate mousse, fruit tarts, and cheesecake. As for beverages, they are not included in the $45 per person; however, we can offer a bar package at an additional cost.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we request a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund. If you cancel after that, we retain a 50% deposit.  

Please let me know if everything looks good to you, and I would be happy to finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thanks for clarifying everything. I appreciate the additional dessert options and the information on the bar package. After discussing with my team, we would like to proceed with the buffet for 100 guests at the total price of $4,500, which includes the kosher menu and VAT.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize the arrangements. Looking forward to working together!
