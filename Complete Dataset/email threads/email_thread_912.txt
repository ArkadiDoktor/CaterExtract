For your event, we can offer a mixed menu with both meat and dairy dishes, including popular choices such as grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate up to 200 guests, with a minimum of 100, and our pricing starts at $45 per person. This price includes VAT and covers setup and staffing.  

If you're interested, we can also discuss beverage options, as our packages can be tailored to include a full bar or just non-alcoholic beverages. Please let me know if you'd like to set up a time to discuss further details.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, especially the salmon. I wanted to clarify a few things before we proceed.  

Is the kosher option available for the meat dishes, and if so, what supervision do you have? Additionally, could you provide more details on the cancellation policy? We're looking at approximately 150 guests but want to ensure we can adjust if needed. Also, could you confirm if the 45 dollars includes beverages or if we need to budget separately for that?  

Looking forward to your reply,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. Yes, we do offer a kosher option and our meat dishes are supervised by the Orthodox Union. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund.  

The quoted price of $45 per person does not include alcoholic beverages; however, we can add a full bar for an additional $15 per person if that interests you. For non-alcoholic beverages, we can provide those at a standard rate. Let me know if you'd like to move forward with the 150 guests or if you have any more questions.  

Warm regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the clarifications. I am happy to confirm the catering for 150 guests with the kosher option included. Please proceed with the menu as discussed, and I would like to add the full bar for an additional $15 per person. This brings the total to $9,000, which I'm fine with.  

Could you please send over a contract detailing everything, including the cancellation policy? I appreciate your assistance and look forward to this collaboration!  

Best,  
Sarah
