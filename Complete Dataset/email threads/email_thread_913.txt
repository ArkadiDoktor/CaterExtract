Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds excellent, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, I would like to clarify a couple of points.  

Is it possible to include a bar service in the package? Additionally, could you provide a final price estimate for 100 guests, including VAT? Lastly, I would like to confirm the cancellation policy in case our plans change.  

Thank you for your assistance.

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your questions. We can certainly include a bar service for an additional $15 per person, which would bring your total to $65 each, inclusive of the VAT. For 100 guests, that would total $6,500.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 10 days before the event for a full refund of any deposits made. If you need to cancel within that timeframe, we can discuss potential alternatives.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the arrangements.  

Best,
