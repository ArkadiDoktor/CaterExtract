Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify a couple of things. Can you confirm if the menu is kosher and if so, what supervision is in place? Additionally, I need to know if beverages are included in the per person fee or if they are an extra cost.  

We are expecting around 100 guests, and I would appreciate a couple of menu suggestions to help finalize our choices. Also, could you provide your cancellation policy?  

Thanks for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. Yes, our menu is indeed kosher, supervised by the London Beth Din, ensuring all dietary laws are adhered to. Beverages, including soft drinks and a selection of wines, are included in the £45 per person fee.  

For the menu, I would suggest our herb-crusted roast chicken, a creamy mushroom risotto, and a fresh garden salad as highlights. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a minimum of seven days' notice for any changes or cancellations without a charge.  

Please let me know if this meets your expectations, and we can proceed with the arrangements.  

Best regards,
