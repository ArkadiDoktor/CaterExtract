Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss catering for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th at the Grand Hotel. We specialize in events like yours and can offer a diverse menu tailored to your needs.  

For this event, we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes full meal service, setup, and staffing. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests and can certainly provide dietary options for vegetarians and gluten-free attendees.  

Please note that our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and all pricing includes VAT. However, beverages and bar service are not included in the base price but can be arranged at an additional cost.  

Would you like to schedule a call to discuss this further?  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed proposal. The $75 per person rate sounds reasonable, but I’d like to confirm if that price includes VAT. Also, could you provide further details on what the mixed menu comprises? We want to ensure there are enough options for all our attendees.  

Additionally, how flexible are you with the guest count? We might have as few as 90 guests based on the RSVP responses.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The price of $75 per person does include VAT. As for the menu, we can offer highlights such as grilled chicken with herbs, a savory vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. If you require additional items or specific dishes, we can certainly accommodate those requests.  

Regarding the guest count, we can work with a minimum of 100 guests but can adjust to 90 for an additional fee of $500 to cover staffing and setup adjustments. I hope this works for you.  

Please let me know if you have any more questions.  

Best,
