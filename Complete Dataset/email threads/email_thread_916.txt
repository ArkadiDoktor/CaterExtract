Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed overview of your services. The pricing is within our budget, but I was wondering if you could offer a slight discount for 100 guests. Additionally, can you clarify whether the $75 includes VAT? We would also like to ensure that you can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options for some of our guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Rachel

Dear Rachel,  

I understand your concerns and am happy to offer a revised price of $70 per person for 100 guests, which does include VAT. We can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as part of our menu. Please note that the final total would be $7,000.  

As for beverages, we can include a selection of soft drinks and juices at no extra charge, but alcoholic beverages would require an additional arrangement.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this proposal or if you have further questions.  

Best regards,  
Michael
