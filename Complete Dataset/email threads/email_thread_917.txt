Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for January 15th. Our company, Gourmet Delights, specializes in providing exquisite dining experiences for events such as yours.  

We can offer a delightful menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes all necessary staffing and equipment for setup and service. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150. Please note that the quoted price does not include VAT, which will be added on top.  

Additionally, we can provide vegetarian options and accommodate other dietary restrictions upon request. If you have any specific dish preferences or would like to see a sample menu, please let me know.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Cohen

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate the rate a bit, especially since we are expecting around 75 guests. Would you be open to reducing the price to $65 per person, given that we can confirm the number of guests soon?  

Also, I’d like to clarify if the bar service is included in the catering package or if that would come at an additional cost. Lastly, how do your cancellation terms work in case of unforeseen circumstances?  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I can understand your concerns regarding the pricing. I can offer a discounted rate of $70 per person for 75 guests, which I believe is a fair compromise.  

Regarding the bar service, it is not included in the catering package, but we can provide a full bar setup at an additional cost if you’re interested. As for cancellation, we typically require at least 14 days' notice for a full refund, with a 50% charge if canceled within that timeframe.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Warm regards,
