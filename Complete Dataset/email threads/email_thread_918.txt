Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your event on March 15th. We are excited at the prospect of catering your corporate gala. Our team specializes in providing high-quality meals with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients.

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu that includes options such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platter, and a variety of gourmet salads. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, which includes all food items and setup. We suggest a minimum of 100 guests and can accommodate up to 250. This price does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.

We can provide kosher meals under supervision from the local rabbinical authority, ensuring all dietary needs are met. Please let us know if you would like to include a bar service as well, as it would be an additional cost.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the mixed menu options you've provided. Before we proceed, I wanted to clarify a couple of details. 

Could you confirm if the $45 per person includes VAT? Additionally, we are considering adding a bar service and would like to know the extra cost associated with that. We expect around 150 guests, but we may have some flexibility on the number. It would be helpful to receive any recommendations for drinks to accompany the meal.

Looking forward to your reply!

Best,

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate your inquiry. To clarify, the $45 per person does not include VAT, which will be calculated separately. For the bar service, we can offer a package that includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks for an additional $15 per person. 

Regarding your guest count, we can easily accommodate 150 guests, and we can adjust the menu accordingly to ensure everyone enjoys their meal. I recommend including a choice of red and white wines that pair well with our dishes. 

Please let me know if you have any specific beverage preferences or additional requests. I look forward to finalizing this with you!

Best wishes,

Hi David,

Thank you for the clarifications. I would like to move forward with the catering as discussed. We will go with the mixed menu at $45 per person plus VAT, and I would like to include the bar service at an additional $15 per person. 

This brings us to a total of $9,000 for 150 guests, which I believe will work well for our budget. Please confirm that the kosher meals will meet the necessary supervision standards. Additionally, I’d like to ensure we have dietary accommodations for a few guests who require vegetarian options.

I look forward to your confirmation and any details regarding the cancellation policy.

Best regards,
