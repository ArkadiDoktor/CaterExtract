Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Cohen, and I am with Gourmet Delights Catering. I understand that you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th and are looking for a catering solution. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to our clients' needs.  

For your event, I recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options to accommodate various preferences. Our pricing typically ranges from $50 to $75 per person, depending on the final menu selection and guest count. For a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150, we can prepare an exquisite selection of dishes, including herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and assorted desserts.  

All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring it meets the highest standards. We can also provide beverages, but please confirm if you would like a full bar service included. Our rates include VAT, and we also offer dietary accommodations for allergies and special diets.  

Please let me know your thoughts or if you would like to discuss this further.  

Best regards,  
David Cohen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information about your catering services. The menu options sound fantastic, especially the herb-crusted chicken. However, before we proceed, I would like to clarify the pricing. Is the $50 to $75 range inclusive of VAT, or will that be added on top? Additionally, we are expecting around 100 guests, and I am interested in a full bar service.  

Could you provide a firm quote for 100 guests with the bar included? Also, please confirm your cancellation policy in case our plans change.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I can confirm that the pricing I offered includes VAT, so you would be looking at a total of $65 per person for 100 guests, which brings the overall total to $6,500. This would include a full bar service with a selection of wines and spirits, in addition to the menu we discussed.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we require notice at least one month prior to the event date for a full refund, which I hope gives you some peace of mind. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best wishes,
