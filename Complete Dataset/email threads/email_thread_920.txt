Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I understand you are organizing a corporate gala on November 15th, and I would love to discuss how we can assist with your catering needs. We specialize in providing a diverse menu that can accommodate various dietary preferences, including kosher options.  

For the gala, we typically offer a per-person pricing structure. Our packages range from $45 to $75 per guest, depending on the menu selection and additional services you may require. We would be delighted to provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

Please let me know the estimated number of guests, as we can accommodate between 50 and 150 attendees. Additionally, I can confirm that our kosher meals are supervised under the Star-K certification.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Joshua,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. We're expecting around 100 guests, so I believe your pricing structure works for us. However, I would like to clarify if the prices you mentioned include VAT, as well as whether beverages are part of the package or if they need to be arranged separately.  

Also, could you give me an idea of the types of dishes typically included in your mixed menu? It’s essential for us to ensure that we can accommodate some guests with dietary restrictions.  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The pricing I provided does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final invoice. As for beverages, we usually offer them separately, but I can provide a comprehensive bar package if you’re interested.  

Regarding the menu, we typically feature dishes like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and assorted desserts. Our team is experienced in accommodating various dietary needs, so we can offer gluten-free and vegetarian options as well.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with a specific package, and I can prepare a final quote based on 100 guests.  

Best wishes,

Hi Joshua,  

Thank you for the additional details. I would like to move forward with your catering services for 100 guests, including the mixed menu and the bar package. Just to confirm, with VAT, the total would be $8,000. Please ensure that the food is delivered and set up an hour before the event starts, as we would like everything to be ready for our guests.  

Can you also send over the cancellation policy at your earliest convenience? Looking forward to finalizing everything soon.  

Best regards,
