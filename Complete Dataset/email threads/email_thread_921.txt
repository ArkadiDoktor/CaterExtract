Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the catering services for your upcoming corporate gala on December 5th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals and would love to discuss how we can make your event memorable.  

Our catering options include a variety of menu types, ranging from mixed cuisine to kosher meals, all of which can accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegetarian options. We typically price our services at $45 per person, which includes setup and staffing. VAT is included in this rate.  

Could you please provide details about the expected number of guests? We can cater events with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the information. We are expecting around 150 guests. Could you confirm if the $45 price includes a bar service, or if that is an additional cost? Additionally, I would like to know more about the kosher supervision you provide.  

We are considering a menu that focuses on dairy and meat options, so any suggestions on representative dishes would be helpful.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your inquiry. The price of $45 per person does not include bar services, which can be offered as an add-on if you are interested. As for kosher meals, we are certified under the supervision of the Local Kosher Board, ensuring all dietary laws are strictly followed.  

For the menu, I recommend our herb-marinated chicken and a rich mushroom risotto, both of which have been popular at similar events. If you are ready to proceed, I can prepare a final proposal with a total cost based on 150 guests.  

Best,
