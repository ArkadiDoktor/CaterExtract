Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming event. We specialize in providing exquisite catering services for weddings, corporate gatherings, and private parties. I understand you are planning a wedding for approximately 100 guests on March 15th.

Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, which includes a full buffet with a selection of meat and vegetarian options, along with dessert. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan options. I would also like to mention that our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.

We can provide a bar service separately if you're interested, as it is not included in the initial pricing. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if cancelled at least two weeks prior to the event. 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.

Best regards,
David Thompson

Dear David,

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm thrilled to hear that you can cater our wedding. However, I would like to clarify a couple of details. While the $75 per person pricing sounds reasonable, could you confirm if VAT is included in that price? Additionally, we are considering a guest range between 80 to 120, so I’d like to know how that might affect the pricing.

Regarding the bar service, could you provide an estimate for that as well? We are also looking for a few specific menu items, like a roast beef option and a vegan pasta dish. 

Looking forward to your response.

Best,

Hello Sarah,

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person rate does not include VAT, which is an additional 10%. For your guest range of 80 to 120, the total price would adjust accordingly, so for 100 guests, the total would be $8,250 including VAT. 

As for the bar service, we can offer a package starting at $1,500 for a standard open bar. I can certainly include the roast beef and vegan pasta on the menu, alongside our signature dishes like chicken piccata and seasonal vegetables. 

Should we proceed, I can prepare a formal contract detailing everything, including our cancellation policy. 

Best,
