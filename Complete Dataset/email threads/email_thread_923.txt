Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify if that $45 per person includes staff for serving and any necessary equipment for the setup. We are expecting around 75 guests, and we would like to ensure that all dietary restrictions are accommodated, particularly for vegan and gluten-free options.  

Additionally, we are considering whether to include a bar with the meal. Could you provide information on the costs associated with that option?  

Thank you,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person does include staff for serving and necessary equipment setup. We can absolutely accommodate vegan and gluten-free options within the mixed menu.  

As for the bar, we can offer a selection of wines and beers for an additional $15 per person. If you decide to proceed with the bar, this would bring the total to $60 per person. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize details.
