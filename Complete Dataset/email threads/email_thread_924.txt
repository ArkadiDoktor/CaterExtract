Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on April 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our offerings include a variety of delicious dishes that can accommodate both meat and dairy preferences, ensuring all your guests are satisfied.  

Based on your expected attendance of 100 guests, we typically charge a fixed price of 80 dollars per person, which includes a three-course meal, staff for setup and service, and all necessary equipment. Please note that VAT is included in this pricing. We can also provide kosher options under the supervision of the local rabbinical council, should that be a requirement.  

Additionally, we offer a selection of beverages, though they are not included in the meal price. If you would like to add a bar service, I can provide separate pricing for that as well.  

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and any specific dietary needs you may have so we can tailor our menu accordingly.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the information about the pricing and kosher options. We are considering a mixed menu that will cater to various dietary preferences, including vegetarian options.  

I would like to confirm the menu structure, as we might have between 80 to 120 guests. Can you provide more details on the specific dishes included in the three-course meal? Additionally, could you clarify if any accommodations can be made for guests with gluten and nut allergies?  

Lastly, if we proceed, what are the cancellation terms?  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I'm glad to hear about the mixed menu preference. For the three-course meal, we typically offer a choice of appetizers like roasted vegetable tart or chicken skewers, main courses such as herb-crusted salmon or stuffed bell peppers, and desserts including chocolate mousse or fruit tarts. We can certainly accommodate gluten and nut allergies with advance notice.  

Regarding your guest count, we can manage between 80 and 120 attendees comfortably at the same per person rate. As for cancellation terms, we allow cancellations up to two weeks before the event with a full refund. After that, a 50% charge applies.  

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you’re ready to move forward with the booking.  

Warm regards,
