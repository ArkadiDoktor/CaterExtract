Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to clarify if the $45 per person includes VAT and if beverages are part of the package. We are expecting around 100 guests and would love to incorporate a bar service if possible.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can confirm that the $45 per person does not include VAT; it will be added on top. Regarding the beverages, we can offer a bar service at an additional cost of $20 per person, which covers a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. The menu can feature dishes like herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a variety of desserts.  

If you decide to proceed, we require a minimum of one week's notice for cancellations to avoid any fees. Please let me know how you would like to move forward.  

Best,
