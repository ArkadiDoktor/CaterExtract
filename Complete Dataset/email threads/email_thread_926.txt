Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special event. Our catering packages offer a variety of menu options, including meat, dairy, and mixed dishes to accommodate different preferences.  

For events like yours, our pricing typically starts at $75 per person for a complete meal, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. All prices include VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union and can accommodate various dietary restrictions upon request. While we do not typically include a bar in our standard packages, we can arrange beverage service separately if that would be of interest to you.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have specific menu preferences in mind.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I appreciate the details you provided. The price of $75 per person seems reasonable, but I was hoping we could explore some options to stay within a budget of $65 per person. Could we consider a simplified menu to help reduce costs?  

Also, could you confirm which specific dishes would be included in the menu at that price point? The gala will be hosted for around 100 guests, and we’d love to ensure there are options for vegetarian attendees as well.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Dear Sarah,  

I completely understand your budget concerns and I'm happy to work with you on this. If we adjust the menu to focus on a selection of our most popular dishes, we can bring the price down to $65 per person. This would include options like roasted chicken, a vegetarian pasta dish, and a seasonal salad.  

We will ensure that there are vegetarian options available for your guests. I also want to confirm that our kosher meals will still be provided under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. As for beverages, we can arrange for a cash bar or provide non-alcoholic options at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can draft a formal agreement.  

Best regards,
