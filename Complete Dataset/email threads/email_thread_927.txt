Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. I am excited about the opportunity to provide catering services for your event. We specialize in a mixed menu that can cater to a variety of dietary needs, ensuring that all guests are satisfied.  

For this event, we can offer a selection of dishes including grilled chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and a variety of seasonal salads. Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, and this includes all food items and standard serving equipment. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Please note that VAT is included in the pricing.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority. However, beverages and a bar service are not included in the quoted price but can be arranged at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you have any specific requests or if you’d like to discuss this proposal further.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds delicious, and I appreciate the inclusion of kosher options. However, I wanted to clarify a couple of points.  

We expect around 100 guests, but there might be a slight increase. If we proceed with the current pricing of $45 per person, could you provide a breakdown of what the total cost would be with 120 guests? Also, could you confirm if the bar and beverage options are customizable based on our preferences?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Samantha,  

Thank you for your questions. If we adjust the count to 120 guests, the total would be $5,400, as the pricing remains at $45 per person. We can certainly customize the bar and beverage options to suit your event's theme and preferences, though those would be priced separately.  

Regarding cancellation, we require a notice of at least two weeks before the event date for a full refund of the deposit. If you have any further requests or need assistance with the bar options, please let me know.  

Looking forward to finalizing details with you.  

Best,
