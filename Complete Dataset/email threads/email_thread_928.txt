Dear Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing you provided seems reasonable for our gala dinner. However, we are expecting between 70 and 90 guests, so I wanted to confirm if the per-person rate remains the same for that range. Additionally, would you be able to include a selection of beverages, or would that be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your clarification.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your inquiry. The rate of £45 per person is indeed applicable for your expected guest count. Regarding beverages, we typically do not include them in the base package, but I can offer a bar package at an additional £15 per person that includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the bar option or if you have any other questions or needs.  

Best,

Dear Michael,  

Thank you for the details. I would like to confirm our catering arrangement for 80 guests at £45 per person, totaling £3,600, which includes VAT. We will also opt for the bar package, bringing the final total to £4,800. Please prepare a menu that includes mixed meat and dairy options, and ensure that all food is kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din.  

Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide staff for the event and all necessary equipment for setup. As discussed, we are aware of the cancellation terms and will provide you with a final guest count two weeks prior to the event.  

Looking forward to working together!
