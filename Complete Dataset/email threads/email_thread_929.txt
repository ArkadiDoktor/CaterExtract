Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, but I was hoping to discuss the price a bit more. Our budget is a little tight for this charity event, and we were considering a range of 60 to 70 dollars per person. Is there any flexibility on your part? Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service is included in the price or if it would be an extra charge?  

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your assistance in making this event memorable.  

Best,
