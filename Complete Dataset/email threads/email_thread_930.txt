Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel from Gourmet Gatherings, and I would be delighted to assist you with catering for your upcoming wedding on May 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisine types, and I believe we can create a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

Our typical pricing structure is $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and all our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the OK. We also offer a range of dietary accommodations, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Additionally, we can discuss whether you would like to include a beverage service or a full bar in your package. If you have any specific menu preferences or ideas, please let me know, and I would be happy to work them into our proposal.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
Daniel

Dear Daniel,  

Thank you for your quick response and the initial proposal. I appreciate your flexibility with dietary options, as we will have some guests with specific needs. Before we proceed, could you clarify if the $75 per person includes VAT, and if you have any specific menu items in mind? Additionally, I would like to know more about the cancellation policy in case plans change.  

As for the bar service, we are considering a modest selection of wines and soft drinks, but I would like to keep that separate from the meal pricing unless you have a package that offers a good value.  

Looking forward to your clarifications.  

Best,  
Jessica

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The price of $75 per person does include VAT. For the menu, I recommend a mixed option featuring our popular beef brisket, roasted seasonal vegetables, and a delightful chocolate mousse for dessert. We can also provide a selection of wines and non-alcoholic beverages at an additional cost, or we can create a package that bundles them together for a discounted rate.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to two weeks before the event for a full refund. After that, a partial refund may apply depending on the circumstances.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,  
Daniel

Thank you for the detailed information. I would like to move forward with the catering arrangements as discussed. We will go with the mixed menu and include the wine selection as a package. I confirm the final price at $75 per person for 120 guests, bringing the total to $9,000. Please let me know the next steps, and if you require a deposit to secure this agreement.  

Looking forward to working with you.  

Best regards,
