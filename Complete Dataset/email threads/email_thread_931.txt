Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your wedding reception on June 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would love to help make your event special.  

For a wedding of this nature, we typically recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options to cater to all guests. Our pricing structure is set at a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, a main course, and dessert. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and all meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

As for beverages, we can provide a bar service for an additional fee. We also offer dietary accommodations, including gluten-free and vegan options. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there are any specific dishes you have in mind.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The $75 per person rate sounds reasonable, but I would like to confirm whether the VAT is included in that price. Additionally, since we anticipate around 120 guests, could you provide a few examples of the dishes you typically serve? I am particularly interested in ensuring that we have a good balance of options available.  

Lastly, could you clarify your cancellation policy? It’s important for us to understand the terms in case we need to make any changes as the date approaches.  

Thanks again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person rate does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. For the menu, we often offer dishes such as honey-glazed brisket, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a delightful chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we allow cancellations up to one month before the event for a full refund. However, cancellations made within 30 days of the event will incur a fee equivalent to 50% of the total estimated cost. If you decide to proceed, we would be happy to finalize the details and secure your date.  

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to move forward.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying those points. I appreciate the menu examples and the cancellation policy details. After discussing with my fiancé, we would like to proceed with the catering for approximately 120 guests at the agreed price of $75 per person, making the total cost $9,000. We are happy with the menu options provided and would like to include the bar service as well.  

Please confirm the arrangements, and I will send over the deposit to secure our date. Looking forward to working with you!
