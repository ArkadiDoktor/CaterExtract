Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the catering options for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing a wide variety of dishes tailored to meet your needs.  

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes a full buffet service and staff for the event. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and our meals are under strict kosher supervision from the Orthodox Union.  

For the menu, we typically offer a mixed option that includes popular items such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of salads. Additionally, we can provide beverages for an extra charge. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements, and I would be happy to assist.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Ethan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds delightful, and I appreciate the kosher supervision detail. However, I was hoping to get a little more flexibility in pricing, especially considering the number of guests we might have. Is there any room for negotiation on the per person rate?  

Also, it is important to note that we may have specific dietary restrictions to accommodate, such as vegan options. Can we discuss that further?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Jessica,  

I understand your concerns regarding the pricing. Given the scale of your event, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person if you confirm a minimum of 120 guests. We can also include a couple of vegan options in the menu to meet dietary needs.  

Please note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than 30 days prior to the event. Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement.
