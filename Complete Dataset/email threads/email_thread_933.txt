Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on November 10th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our typical offerings include a mixed menu featuring seasonal meats and a variety of sides, which can be adjusted to accommodate dietary restrictions.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, our pricing is set at $50 per person, which includes VAT. We also offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, if needed. Please let me know if you would like to include a beverage package, as this would be separate from the meal cost.  

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and any specific requirements you may have.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the options. I appreciate the flexibility with the menu. However, I would like to clarify a few details before proceeding. We expect around 75 guests and would prefer a vegetarian option alongside the meat selections. Can you confirm if the $50 per person includes a full bar service as well?  

Additionally, if we were to finalize the agreement, what would the cancellation terms look like?  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your inquiries. The $50 per person does not include the bar service; we can provide a separate package for that, which typically ranges from $15 to $25 per person, depending on the selections. As for the vegetarian option, we can certainly include a delicious array of dishes to cater to all tastes.  

Regarding cancellation, we generally require at least two weeks' notice for a full refund, while a 50% charge would apply for cancellations made closer to the event date.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement, and I can prepare a formal contract for you.  

Best,
