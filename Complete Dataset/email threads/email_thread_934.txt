Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services, and I am excited to help you create a memorable experience for your guests.  

For this event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing is set at $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, along with appropriate tableware and setup. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT.  

We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests, and we are happy to provide options for dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free or vegetarian dishes. If you would like beverages included, we can discuss a bar package separately.  

Let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any questions.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and for the detailed proposal. I appreciate the kosher certification, as it is important for our guests. However, I was hoping to discuss the price a bit further, as our budget is tight this year. Would you be willing to adjust the price to $65 per person? Additionally, could you clarify if the VAT is included in the $75 price?  

I’m also curious about the bar options. Can you provide more information on what packages are available?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand the need to stay within budget, and I can offer you a price of $70 per person, which I believe is a fair compromise. The VAT is not included in the initial price; it will be added on top. As for the bar options, we have several packages ranging from a basic soft drink service to a full bar with cocktails and wine. I can send you a detailed list of those options.  

Please let me know if the adjusted price works for you, and I would be happy to finalize the details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your flexibility and for clarifying the details. I can agree to the $70 per person price, so let's move forward with the catering for 100 guests, which totals $7,000 before VAT. Please include the basic bar package for soft drinks.  

I also want to confirm that we will need everything set up by 6 PM, and I would appreciate your staffing for serving the food. Regarding cancellation, could you please confirm the policy for any potential changes?  

Thanks for your assistance, and I look forward to working together.  

Best,
