Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Culinary Delights regarding your upcoming event on June 15th. We would be delighted to cater your corporate gala, which I understand will have approximately 100 guests. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes a wide selection of dishes prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din.  

Our menu features a variety of meat options, and we can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free requests. Please note that our pricing is inclusive of VAT, and we can provide a separate bar service for an additional fee, should you require it.  

Once we finalize the menu, I will share a detailed proposal for your review. We typically require a minimum of 50 guests and can cater for up to 150. Please also be aware that we have a cancellation policy that allows for a full refund if canceled at least 30 days prior to the event.  

Looking forward to your response so we can discuss this further.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The details you've provided sound promising. However, I wanted to clarify if the £45 per person covers everything, including setup and staffing. Additionally, would you be able to provide options for a bar, and how does that affect the overall price?  

We are looking to have a maximum of 120 guests, and I would appreciate if you could include some examples of the dishes you would recommend. If we decide to go ahead, we would need to confirm everything by the end of next week.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your inquiries. The £45 per person does include setup and staffing for the event, ensuring everything runs smoothly. As for the bar service, we can offer a selection of beverages for an additional £15 per person, which includes soft drinks and a choice of wines.  

In terms of menu highlights, I would recommend our herb-crusted roast chicken, along with a delightful quinoa salad and seasonal roasted vegetables. If you have specific preferences or other dishes in mind, please let me know.  

I will prepare a more detailed proposal with all options included so you can make an informed decision.  

Best wishes,
