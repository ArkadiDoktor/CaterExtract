Hi David,  

Thank you for the prompt response and for the details regarding the menu and pricing. The mixed menu with kosher supervision sounds ideal for our gala. I would like to confirm that the pricing includes VAT, and I appreciate the options for dietary accommodations.  

However, as we are still finalizing our guest list, would you be able to offer a slight discount if we exceed 100 guests? Additionally, could you provide some examples of the dishes included in the menu?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

I appreciate your quick reply. If you exceed 100 guests, I can offer a rate of $70 per person. As for the menu highlights, we typically include items such as herb-crusted roast chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. We can also create a dessert bar featuring assorted pastries and fresh fruit.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any other specific dishes in mind. We can finalize the details soon to ensure everything is set for your event.
