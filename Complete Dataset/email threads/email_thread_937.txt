Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food that caters to a range of dietary needs, and I believe we could create a memorable experience for you and your guests.

For your event, I recommend our mixed menu, which includes options like grilled salmon, herb-roasted chicken, and a selection of seasonal vegetables. We can accommodate up to 150 guests, and our pricing is structured at $50 per person, which includes all food preparation and setup. Please note that VAT is included in this price.

If you would like us to provide beverages, we can offer a separate bar package that includes a variety of wines and cocktails. Additionally, all of our dishes are kosher and prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts or any specific requirements you might have.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds great, but I need to clarify a couple of things. We’re expecting between 100 to 150 guests, and I’d like to confirm if the $50 per person price is fixed or if it changes based on the final guest count.

Additionally, could you provide more information about the cancellation policy? I want to ensure we have everything covered as we finalize our plans.

Thanks again, and I look forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I appreciate your questions. The $50 per person rate is fixed regardless of whether you have 100 or 150 guests, so you can plan confidently. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund up to 30 days before the event. After that, we retain a 25% deposit.

If you have any specific dietary restrictions or preferences, please let me know, and we can adjust the menu accordingly. 

Looking forward to working together to make your wedding a success.

Warm regards,
