Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options you mentioned sound great. However, I was hoping to discuss the pricing a bit further. Given our budget constraints, would it be possible to reduce the price to $40 per person? If we could stay at that rate, we could confirm the order for 75 guests.  

Additionally, could you provide a few examples of the dishes included in the mixed menu? We want to ensure we cater to a variety of tastes.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your flexibility and interest in our catering service. While I understand your budget concerns, I can offer a package at $42 per person for 75 guests, including VAT. This would still allow us to provide quality dishes, such as grilled chicken with roasted vegetables, a selection of gourmet salads, and a delicious chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Unfortunately, we cannot lower the price further without compromising on the quality of the ingredients. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare the necessary paperwork.  

Warm regards,
