Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Events. We are excited about the opportunity to cater your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We pride ourselves on providing high-quality food and service tailored to your needs.  

For a wedding of this size, we typically recommend a menu that includes a mix of meat and dairy options, ensuring there is something for everyone. Our pricing structure is set at $85 per person, and this includes all food, setup, and staffing. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 150. We are also pleased to inform you that our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if you would be interested in discussing this further, and I can send over a sample menu along with any additional details about our services.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,  
Daniel Thompson

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The proposed pricing seems reasonable. However, I wanted to clarify if the $85 per person includes VAT or if that would be added separately. Additionally, I am interested to know if beverages are included in that price, as we are considering having a bar at the event.  

I appreciate your attention to the kosher requirements, and I would love to see the sample menu. Could you also let me know if you can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options?  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $85 per person does not include VAT, which would be added on top of that. Beverages are not included in the base price, but we can certainly discuss bar options based on your preferences.  

As for dietary accommodations, we can provide both vegetarian and gluten-free dishes. I will attach a sample menu that showcases our offerings, including items like herb-roasted chicken, seasonal vegetable risotto, and a selection of desserts.  

If everything meets your approval, we can move forward with a final price of $12,750 for 150 guests, which includes setup and staffing. We do have a cancellation policy that allows for full refunds up to two weeks before the event.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,  
Daniel
