Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming charity gala scheduled for February 15, 2024. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our menu features a variety of options, including meat and dairy dishes, ensuring we can cater to different tastes and dietary needs.  

For a guest count ranging from 100 to 150, we typically charge $50 per person. This price includes VAT and covers a full buffet service with a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Additionally, we can accommodate special dietary requests, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options.  

We understand the importance of quality and service for an event like yours, and we ensure that all our food is prepared in accordance with kosher guidelines under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu further or if you have any specific preferences in mind.  

Looking forward to your response.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the initial details regarding your catering services. The menu sounds promising, and I appreciate the kosher supervision aspect. However, we were hoping to keep our budget around $40 per person. Would you be able to adjust the menu to meet this budget?  

Moreover, could you clarify if your price includes beverages or if that would be an additional charge? It would be great to know what the final total would be if we confirm for 125 guests.  

Thank you again for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. We can certainly adjust the menu to fit your budget of $40 per person. This would involve selecting simpler dishes while still maintaining a high standard of quality. Regarding beverages, we currently do not include a bar service in the pricing. However, we can provide a non-alcoholic beverage package for an additional $5 per guest.  

For 125 guests at $40 each, the total would be $5,000, which includes VAT. If you would like to proceed with this arrangement or have further adjustments, please let me know.  

Best wishes,
