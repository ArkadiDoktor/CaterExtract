Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Gala

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your upcoming gala on December 15th. We would be delighted to cater this special event for you. We specialize in a diverse range of cuisines and can provide a menu that aligns with your vision. 

For your event, we typically charge $75 per person. This rate includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and all food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union. Additionally, we can provide a bar service at an extra cost if you're interested.

Please let me know if you have specific preferences or dietary accommodations to consider. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. I appreciate the kosher supervision, as that is essential for our guests. However, could you clarify whether the $75 per person includes VAT? Also, we are considering offering some dietary options for our attendees, particularly vegetarian and gluten-free dishes. 

If we decide to go with your proposal, could we potentially negotiate the price down to $70 per person? This would help us stay within our budget. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

I understand your budget concerns, and I’m happy to work with you. The $75 per person does not include VAT, which is an additional 10%. As for the dietary options, we can certainly provide vegetarian and gluten-free dishes as part of the menu.

Regarding the price, I can offer you a rate of $72 per person if you confirm the minimum of 100 guests. This would bring the total to $7,200 excluding VAT. We can finalize the menu with some highlights such as grilled vegetable skewers, herb-roasted chicken, and assorted desserts.

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal agreement.

Best,

I would also like to understand your cancellation policy before we finalize everything. Once I have this information, I can move forward.
