Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Bites regarding your catering needs for the upcoming charity gala on October 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would love to help you with this important event.  

For a gala like this, we typically suggest a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options to cater to a variety of dietary preferences. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing for the evening. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and please note that this price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we are able to provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din, should that be a requirement for your attendees. I would be happy to discuss specific menu items, including options like roasted chicken, vegetarian lasagna, and seasonal salads.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,  
Michael Johnson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the prompt response and the detailed proposal. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to clarify a few points.  

We expect around 120 guests, and I appreciate the kosher option you mentioned. However, could you confirm if the £45 per person includes beverages, or if that would be an additional cost? Also, are there any dietary accommodations for gluten-free or vegan guests?  

If we move forward, what are your cancellation terms?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The £45 per person covers food and staffing, but beverages would be an additional cost. We can provide a range of options, including a selection of wines and soft drinks, which can be tailored to your needs.  

We are able to accommodate gluten-free and vegan dietary requests, ensuring that all guests can enjoy the meal. As for cancellation, we typically require a notice of two weeks prior to the event to avoid any cancellation fees.  

If you are ready to proceed, I can confirm the final price for 120 guests would be £5,400, inclusive of VAT.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,
