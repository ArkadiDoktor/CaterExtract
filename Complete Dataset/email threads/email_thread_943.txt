Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on December 10th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would love to assist you in making your event memorable.  

For your gala, we offer a variety of menu options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, ensuring a tailored experience for your attendees.  

We provide kosher meals supervised by the London Beth Din, and we can also cater to various dietary needs upon request, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. However, please note that our standard package does not include beverages or a bar service.  

If you are interested, I can provide a sample menu that includes highlights such as herb-marinated chicken, roasted seasonal vegetables, and a delightful chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. I appreciate the kosher supervision and the variety of menu options you offer. However, I would like to confirm if the price of £45 per person is flexible, as our budget is a bit tight.  

Additionally, could you clarify if there are any cancellation terms? We need to ensure we have a contingency plan in place. I would also like to know more about the setup and staffing arrangements.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the budget constraints. We can adjust our pricing to £40 per person if we proceed with a minimum of 100 guests. This would still include VAT and the kosher supervision by the London Beth Din.  

Regarding cancellation, we typically require a notice of at least two weeks prior to the event, after which a fee may apply. As for the setup, our team will arrive three hours before the event starts to ensure everything is ready on time, and we will provide a sufficient number of staff to manage the catering efficiently.  

I hope this meets your needs, and I'm happy to finalize the menu once we confirm details.  

Best,
