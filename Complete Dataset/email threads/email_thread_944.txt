Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your catering needs for the wedding reception on June 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher catering services and would love to assist you with this special occasion.  

Our menu offers a variety of options, including meat, dairy, and mixed dishes, all under strict rabbinical supervision. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests, with a pricing structure of $45 per person. This price includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, and we can also provide beverages for an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements, and we will do our best to accommodate them. I look forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The $45 per person rate sounds reasonable, but could you clarify if this price includes VAT? Also, we are expecting around 80 guests, but we may have to adjust the number slightly depending on RSVPs.  

Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide a sample menu, especially regarding the main courses and any vegetarian options available. It’s important that we can cater to a few guests with dietary restrictions.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The $45 per person price does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the final cost. Our team can certainly provide a sample menu; I will include a variety of main courses, including both meat and vegetarian options to accommodate your guests.  

For 80 guests, the total would come to $3,600 plus VAT. As for dietary restrictions, we can offer gluten-free and dairy-free options to ensure everyone is catered for.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any additional requests.  

Warm regards,
