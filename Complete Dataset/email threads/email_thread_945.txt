Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide our services for this special occasion. Our menu can include a variety of dishes, such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable skewers, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

Our pricing is structured at $45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Additionally, all our food is kosher, supervised by the OU, ensuring it meets the highest standards. Please note that while we can provide a full bar service, it would be an additional cost.  

If you have specific dietary requirements, we are happy to offer vegetarian and gluten-free options. Once we finalize the details, we can also discuss setup and staffing needs.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thanks for your prompt response. The menu sounds fantastic, especially the chicken and vegetable skewers. However, I was hoping to keep the budget a bit lower if possible. Would you be able to adjust the pricing to around $40 per person? Also, could you clarify if the price includes the bar service, or if that’s separate?  

We anticipate around 100 guests but would like to keep the option open for up to 120. Let me know what you think.  

Best,  
Sarah

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback. We can certainly adjust the price to $40 per person if you confirm a minimum of 100 guests. Unfortunately, the bar service would still remain separate, costing an additional $15 per person for a full open bar.  

As for the menu, we can include a meat and dairy option to cater to various preferences, which I believe will work well for your guests. Let me know if this arrangement works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,  
Mark

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your flexibility. I agree to the price of $40 per person for 100 guests, and I understand that the bar service will be an additional $15 per person. Please proceed with the arrangements as discussed, including the kosher supervision and the mixed menu options.  

I also appreciate the inclusion of dietary accommodations. Could you please send over the contract with cancellation terms? I look forward to working together for a successful event.  

Best regards,
