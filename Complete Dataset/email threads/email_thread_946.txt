Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming corporate retreat. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to various dietary needs and preferences. For your event, we can offer a selection of mixed menu options including vegetarian, meat, and pareve dishes. 

Our pricing structure is typically based on a per-person rate, which allows for flexibility depending on your final guest count. The price ranges from $40 to $60 per person, which includes a full buffet setup, staffing, and all necessary equipment. Please note that our prices do not include VAT, which will be added on top of the total. 

We can accommodate between 50 to 100 guests and ensure that all food served is under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. If you would like to discuss specific menu items or any additional requests, I would be happy to assist. 

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your detailed proposal. I appreciate the flexibility in your pricing structure. However, I would like to clarify a few points before we proceed. For our corporate retreat scheduled on March 15th, we expect around 75 guests. Would you be able to provide a fixed price for this number of attendees? Additionally, could you outline the menu highlights, specifically regarding any signature dishes?  

Also, please confirm whether beverages are included in your initial pricing. It would be great to have a couple of options for dietary accommodations as well.  

Thank you for your assistance.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your prompt response. For 75 guests, we can offer a fixed price of $4,500, which does include the buffet setup and staffing, but please note that beverages are not included in that price. Our beverage packages can start from an additional $15 per person.  

As for the menu, we can feature items such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable platters, and a variety of salads. We can certainly accommodate dietary requests, including gluten-free and vegan options, upon request.  

Let me know if this meets your expectations, and if you have any other questions or adjustments.
