Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you've provided. I appreciate the range in pricing, but could you clarify if your menu options are kosher? We have several attendees who observe kosher dietary laws, and it’s essential to ensure that the food meets the necessary standards. If it is kosher, I'd also like to know what supervision you have in place.  

Additionally, while I understand the price range, could we aim for a fixed price of $50 per person? If you could provide a sample menu that fits within this budget, that would be great.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick follow-up. Our offerings can indeed be kosher, supervised by the local Kashrut authority, ensuring compliance with dietary laws. I can certainly work with the fixed price of $50 per person and will draft a sample menu that includes a variety of options within that budget.  

Regarding beverages, we usually recommend including a bar service as an add-on, but I can provide some options for non-alcoholic beverages as part of the per-person price if that suits your needs better.  

Let me know if you have any specific dishes in mind or if you would like to see our standard offerings.  

Best,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the clarification regarding the kosher supervision; that certainly puts my mind at ease. I would love to see the sample menu that fits the $50 per person price. Please include some of the representative dishes you think would work best for a corporate gathering.  

If everything looks good, I’m ready to proceed with a booking for 80 guests. Also, could you confirm the cancellation policy just in case?  

Thanks for your assistance, and I look forward to your menu proposal.  

Best,
