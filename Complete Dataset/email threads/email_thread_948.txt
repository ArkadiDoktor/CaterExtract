Subject: Catering Proposal for Your Upcoming Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a catering proposal for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. At Gourmet Delights, we specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and we would be thrilled to cater your event.  

We can offer a mixed menu that includes a selection of gourmet appetizers, main courses featuring both meat and vegetarian options, and a variety of desserts. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. This price includes VAT, and we ensure that all our offerings are kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

Please note that our package does not include a bar but we can provide a range of non-alcoholic beverages. I would be happy to discuss any dietary requirements you might have, as we can cater to gluten-free and vegan options.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,  
Michael Thompson

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic! However, I wanted to inquire if there is any flexibility in the pricing, especially since we are expecting around 120 guests. Could we possibly negotiate the per-person price to $65? Additionally, could you confirm whether the setup and staffing costs are included in your proposal?  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your reply.  

Warm regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I completely understand your position on the budget. While we typically maintain our pricing at $75 per person due to the quality of our ingredients and service, I can offer a special rate of $70 per person for 120 guests. This adjusted price will still include VAT and the kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.  

As for the setup and staffing, that is included in our service, ensuring a seamless experience for your event. If you have any further questions or adjustments in mind, please let me know.  

Best,
