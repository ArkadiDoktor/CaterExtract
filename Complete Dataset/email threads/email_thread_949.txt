Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information you provided. I would like to clarify if your catering is kosher and what supervision you have in place, as that is essential for our event.  

Additionally, while I understand the price is $75 per person, can you confirm if there is any flexibility on that rate? We are expecting around 150 guests, and I would like to keep our budget in check. If we can finalize the details soon, it will help with our planning.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Yes, we can provide kosher meals, supervised by the Vaad Harabonim, ensuring all dietary laws are strictly observed.  

Regarding the pricing, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person if you confirm the booking for 150 guests. This rate will still include VAT and the setup. We can also discuss options for a bar package if you decide to include drinks.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal proposal.  

Warm regards,
