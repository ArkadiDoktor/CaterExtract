Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the catering for your upcoming wedding on May 20th. We would be delighted to assist you in making this day special. Given your guest list of approximately 100 to 150 people, we can offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options.  

Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring options like grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet salads. We can accommodate dietary restrictions as well, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. Please let me know if you're interested in beverages, as we can provide a full bar package at an additional cost.  

For kosher supervision, our meals are certified kosher under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council. I can send over our menu options for your review. We kindly ask for a final guest count two weeks before the event, and our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if cancelled at least 30 days in advance.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
David Rosen

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The menu options sound great, particularly the grilled chicken and gourmet salads. I appreciate your flexibility with dietary restrictions as well.  

I would like to confirm the catering for 130 guests, but I’m wondering if there’s any room for negotiation on the price per person. Our budget is slightly tight, and I’d prefer to keep the total within $9,000. Could you offer a fixed price for the event that might work for both of us? Additionally, could you clarify if VAT is included in that $75 price?  

Thanks again for your help.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand the budget constraints, and I appreciate your transparency. I can offer you a fixed price of $70 per person for 130 guests, totaling $9,100. This includes all food, and yes, VAT is included in that price.  

Regarding the bar, we can offer a package based on your preferences, but it would be separate from the meal cost. Let me know if you're interested in that option, and I can provide details. Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this arrangement, and I will prepare the formal agreement.  

Looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

I’ll send over the final guest count and any specific dietary requirements as we finalize the details. Thank you for your excellent service so far; I look forward to working together to make this event a success!
