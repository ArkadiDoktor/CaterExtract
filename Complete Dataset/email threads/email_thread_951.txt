Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Events for your catering needs. We specialize in providing high-quality food for a variety of occasions, and I would be thrilled to assist you with your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for November 15th.  

For this event, we offer a mixed menu that includes options for both meat and dairy. Our pricing is structured at $60 per person, which includes a full meal, appetizers, and dessert. We can accommodate between 100 to 150 guests, and I want to confirm that the price includes VAT.  

Additionally, we can provide kosher options under the supervision of the OU, and we are able to cater to various dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free meals. Please let me know if you would like to see a sample menu, and I can send that over right away.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,

Hi Oliver,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details you provided. The proposed pricing is appealing, but I wanted to clarify if beverages and a bar service are included in that $60 per person rate. If they are not, could you provide separate pricing for that?  

Also, while I appreciate the kosher options, I would like to ensure that there are adequate vegan choices available as well since some of our guests have specific dietary restrictions.  

I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $60 per person does not include bar service; however, we can offer a bar package at an additional $15 per person. As for the menu, we can certainly incorporate a variety of vegan options alongside our kosher selections, ensuring that we meet all dietary needs.  

If we finalize the agreement soon, we would also need to discuss setup and staffing, as we prefer to have our team manage the entire catering process for a seamless experience.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a detailed menu proposal.  

Best,

With 120 guests expected, the final price will be $9,000, including VAT. Please confirm the details and provide the cancellation policy so we can finalize everything.
