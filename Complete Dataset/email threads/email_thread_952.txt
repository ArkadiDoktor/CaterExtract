Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate retreat on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this event. Our team specializes in a variety of menu options, including kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring dishes such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and assorted desserts. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, and this includes VAT. We typically cater for a minimum of 30 guests and can accommodate up to 100. Beverages are not included in the base price but can be added if you’re interested.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any specific dietary requirements.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds appealing, especially the grilled chicken. However, we are expecting approximately 120 guests, which exceeds your maximum capacity. Is it possible for you to accommodate more attendees? Additionally, could you provide more details about the beverages? We would prefer to have a bar included if possible.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest and understand the need for larger accommodations. We can actually extend our capacity to 130 guests for your event. As for beverages, we can include a basic bar package for an additional $15 per person, which covers wine, beer, and soft drinks.  

If you confirm the number of guests and any dietary options, I can prepare a detailed proposal including the final price. Please let me know your thoughts.  

Warm regards,
