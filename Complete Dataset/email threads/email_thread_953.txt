Dear Clara,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for your event. Our standard offering includes a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy options, ensuring that we can accommodate different preferences.  

We typically charge a fixed price of $55 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing for the evening. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that our prices do include VAT.  

Additionally, we offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we can discuss specific dietary accommodations as needed. While our catering includes a selection of beverages, a full bar is available for an additional cost.  

I would love to discuss this further and tailor the menu to fit your needs. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to explore the possibility of reducing it to $50 per person if we can keep the guest count closer to the minimum of 50. Additionally, could you clarify what beverages are included in the package?  

We are particularly interested in ensuring that the menu provides options for those who are vegetarian and gluten-free, so any highlights along those lines would be appreciated.  

Best,

I appreciate your feedback. We can accommodate your request and offer the reduced price of $50 per person for a minimum of 50 guests. In terms of beverages, our package includes sparkling water, soft drinks, and coffee, but we can certainly adjust that based on your needs.  

For dietary accommodations, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options, including dishes such as roasted vegetable quinoa salad and a selection of seasonal fruits. Please let me know if you'd like to finalize the details, including the menu and any additional services.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your adjustments. I am happy to confirm the catering at $50 per person for 50 guests with the menu options and beverages as discussed. I’d also like to ensure we have a clear cancellation policy in place, perhaps allowing for cancellations up to one week before the event without penalty.  

Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything. Looking forward to working with you!
