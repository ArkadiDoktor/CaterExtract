Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming bar mitzvah on March 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this special occasion. Our menu offers a variety of options, including meat and dairy dishes, with a focus on high-quality ingredients and presentation.  

For your event, we typically charge a fixed price of $70 per person, which includes a three-course meal, hors d'oeuvres, and a dessert station. This price is based on a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. We can also provide kosher meals under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, if that is required.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary restrictions or preferences, and I can customize the menu accordingly. Additionally, we can discuss beverage options separately, as those are not included in the base price.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the details provided. I appreciate the menu options, but I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit. Would you be able to lower it to $65 per person? We are expecting around 75 guests, and I want to ensure we stay within our budget.  

Additionally, could you confirm if the quoted price includes VAT? We would also like to know about any beverage packages you might recommend, as we are considering a separate bar service.  

Thanks again for your help!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your response. I can offer you the $65 per person rate if we can confirm a minimum of 75 guests. The price does not include VAT, which is an additional 20%. Regarding beverages, we have options for a full bar package or a wine and beer service that can be tailored to your needs.  

Please let me know if you're interested, and I can provide more details about the drinks menu and any dietary accommodations we can make.  

Looking forward to your reply.
