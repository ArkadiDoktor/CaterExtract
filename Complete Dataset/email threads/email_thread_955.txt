Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our menu options include a variety of dishes that cater to different dietary needs, and we can offer a mixed menu with both meat and vegetarian selections.  

For your event, we can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests. Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes VAT, ensuring no hidden costs. We also offer a kosher menu under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. Please let us know if you'd like us to include a beverage package as well, as that would be an additional cost.  

We look forward to discussing this further.  

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the kosher options and the inclusion of VAT in the pricing. However, I would like to clarify the beverage situation. Could you provide an estimate for including a bar service? Additionally, can we explore the possibility of adjusting the price to $40 per person if we finalize the guest count at 150?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your interest in our services and your inquiry about the bar service. The beverage package would typically be an additional $15 per person, which covers a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks. Regarding the price adjustment, I can offer the rate of $40 per person for 150 guests, provided we receive a finalized agreement by the end of next week.  

Please let me know if this works for you so we can proceed with the arrangements.  

Warm regards,
