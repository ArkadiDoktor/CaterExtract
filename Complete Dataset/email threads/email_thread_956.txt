Dear Laura,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate retreat on April 15th. We specialize in providing a variety of menus tailored to suit different tastes and dietary needs. For an event like yours, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options.  

Our pricing is set at $45 per person, which includes setup, staff, and all necessary equipment. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and can go up to 100. All our dishes are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and we can also provide options for guests with dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegan meals. Please note that our prices do not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate.  

I would be happy to discuss this further or answer any questions you may have.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher supervision detail. I was wondering if you could offer a slight discount if we increase the guest count to 80. Also, could you clarify if beverages are included in the package, or if that would be an additional cost?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Laura,  

I appreciate your interest in increasing the guest count. If you confirm 80 guests, I can reduce the price to $42 per person. Beverages are not included in the base price, but we can offer a bar package at an additional cost of $15 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and if you have any other questions about the menu or arrangements.  

Best,
