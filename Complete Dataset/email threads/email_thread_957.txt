Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the prompt reply. I appreciate the information you provided. I do have a few questions. Could we possibly adjust the price to $70 per person if we confirm a guest count closer to the minimum of 50? Also, can you clarify if the meals are prepared under any kosher supervision? We have some guests who strictly adhere to kosher dietary laws.  

Additionally, it would be helpful to know if you can accommodate vegan options for some of our guests.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. I can agree to the price of $70 per person if you confirm at least 50 guests. Our meals are indeed prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K organization, ensuring that all dietary laws are adhered to. I can also include a few vegan options in the menu for your guests.  

Regarding the beverages, we can provide a selection of soft drinks and juices as part of the package, but please note that a full bar would be at an additional cost.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a formal proposal including the menu highlights.  

Best wishes,
