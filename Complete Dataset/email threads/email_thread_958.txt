Hi Emily,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The gourmet menu sounds fantastic. We expect around 80 guests, and I appreciate the flexibility in the menu options.  

I would like to confirm that the pricing of $45 per person includes VAT, as you mentioned. However, could you clarify whether the bar services are included in that price or if it would be an additional cost? We are also considering a few specific dishes, such as the herb-crusted chicken and the roasted vegetable platter.  

Looking forward to your clarification so we can move forward.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thanks for your reply. The bar services would be an additional cost, typically around $15 per person for a full bar setup. As for the menu items, both the herb-crusted chicken and roasted vegetable platter are excellent choices and fit perfectly within our offerings.  

With 80 guests, the total would come to $3,600, which includes the gourmet meat dishes, vegetarian options, and VAT. We can accommodate any dietary restrictions you might have, so please let us know if there are any specific needs.  

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this arrangement, and we can discuss the next steps and the cancellation policy, which is typically 48 hours prior to the event.
