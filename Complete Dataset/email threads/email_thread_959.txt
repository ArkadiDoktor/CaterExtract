Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided so far. I wanted to clarify whether your offerings are kosher, as we have several guests who adhere to strict dietary laws. If they are kosher, could you please specify the supervision?  

Additionally, I would like to explore if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, as we are working with a budget that might require some adjustments. I am thinking of approximately 200 guests, but I will confirm the final headcount shortly.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Sara,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Our menu is indeed kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring that all dietary requirements are met. As for the pricing, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person if you confirm for 200 guests, which would bring the total to $14,000.  

Regarding the bar service, it can be included for an additional $15 per person, which covers a selection of wines and soft drinks. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, and if you have any other questions.  

Best regards,
