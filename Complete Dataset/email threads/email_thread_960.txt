I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out from Gourmet Delights to discuss catering for your upcoming corporate gala on December 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to specific dietary needs and would love to assist you in making your event memorable.  

Our pricing structure is typically based on a per-person rate, and we have a range of menu options that can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests. We offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy dishes, with vegetarian and gluten-free options available. Additionally, our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The gala is indeed an important event for us, and I appreciate your detailed information. I am particularly interested in understanding the pricing better. Could you provide a specific rate per person? We are also considering whether to include beverages or a bar service in our catering plan.  

Looking forward to your clarification on these points.  

Warm regards,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your interest in our services. For the gala, our rate is set at $85 per person for the mixed menu, which includes the main courses, appetizers, and desserts. If you choose to include a full bar service, it would be an additional $30 per person.  

It’s worth noting that the prices include VAT and we can accommodate up to 200 guests. As for the cancellation policy, we require a minimum of two weeks' notice for any cancellations to avoid charges. Please let me know if this works for you, and I can provide a sample menu for your review.
