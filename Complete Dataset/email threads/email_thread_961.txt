Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your catering needs. We are excited to assist you with your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. Our team specializes in high-quality, kosher cuisine and can provide a diverse menu tailored to your guests' preferences.  

For your event, we typically recommend a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 200 guests, ensuring that we have the right setup for your expected attendance.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss menu options or have any specific requests in mind.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I would like to confirm some details. Can you provide more information about the specific menu items available? Also, we may have guests with dietary restrictions, so knowing the options for accommodations would be helpful.  

If we proceed with 150 guests, can you confirm the total cost? Additionally, does the price include beverages, or is that an extra charge?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I'm glad to hear from you again. For a mixed menu, we can offer highlights such as herb-roasted chicken, stuffed mushrooms, and a variety of salads. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

For 150 guests, the total would be $11,250, including VAT. However, the beverage service is not included in that price; we can discuss options for a bar setup if you're interested. Our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed!  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. We would like to proceed with the catering for 150 guests at the total cost of $11,250. Please confirm that the menu will be kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we will need to discuss the bar options further.  

Once we finalize these details, please send over the contract for our review.  

Best regards,
