For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, ensuring a diverse selection for your guests.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the initial details. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate that the pricing includes VAT. However, I wanted to clarify if the meals are kosher and, if so, what supervision you follow. Additionally, could you confirm whether beverages are included in your proposal?  

Lastly, we expect around 120 guests, so if we were to finalize the arrangement, I would like to know if there is flexibility in the pricing if we exceed that number.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your inquiry. I can confirm that our meals are kosher and are prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. Regarding beverages, we do not include a bar in our standard package, but we can provide a selection of soft drinks and a cash bar option if that suits your needs.  

As for pricing, if your guest count exceeds 120, we can adjust the total to $42 per person for each additional guest. This adjustment remains inclusive of VAT.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed or if you have any other questions.  

Best wishes,
