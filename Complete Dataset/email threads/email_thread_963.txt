Thank you for reaching out about catering for your upcoming wedding reception on May 12th. At Gourmet Bites, we specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would love to help make your event special.  

We offer a range of menu options, including a delightful selection of mixed meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. Our pricing starts at $75 per person and includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests, depending on your needs.  

Additionally, we can provide a full bar service for an extra charge or non-alcoholic beverages included in the package. We are also happy to cater to any dietary restrictions your guests may have.

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information on your catering services. The menu sounds wonderful, and I appreciate the kosher certification. However, I am looking for a more budget-friendly option. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?  

Also, could you clarify what types of dishes would be included in the mixed menu? I want to ensure we have a good variety for our guests. Finally, we may have closer to 200 guests, so I’d like to understand if you can accommodate that number.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Rachel

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the budget considerations. For a guest count of 200, I can offer a revised package at $70 per person, which still includes VAT. As for the menu, we can provide a selection of grilled chicken, beef brisket, roasted vegetables, and various salads, ensuring a balanced and appealing feast.  

We can certainly accommodate 200 guests, and I can also arrange for additional staff if needed for service. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best wishes,  
Jonathan Green
