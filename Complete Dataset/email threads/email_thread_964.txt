Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The $75 per person price point sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss potential adjustments. Our budget is a bit tight, and I wanted to see if there’s any flexibility in the pricing, especially if we secure the upper limit of 200 guests. Additionally, could you clarify whether beverages are included in that price?  

I appreciate that you can accommodate dietary restrictions, but I would like to know more about the specific options available for vegan or gluten-free attendees.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Rebecca

Hi Rebecca,  

I understand your concerns regarding the budget, and I'm happy to offer a revised rate of $70 per person for 200 guests, which would bring the total to $14,000. This price still includes VAT, and I can confirm that beverages are not included in this package, but we can certainly arrange a bar service for an additional fee.  

In terms of dietary accommodations, we can provide vegan and gluten-free options, including a delicious quinoa salad and roasted vegetable platter. If you have any further requirements, I’m here to help.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the details.  

Best,  
David

Dear David,  

Thank you for the updated proposal. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the pricing. I would like to confirm the catering for 200 guests at the rate of $70 per person, bringing the total to $14,000. This agreement will include the kosher meals under the Orthodox Union supervision, and we will arrange for the bar service separately.  

I understand that we have a cancellation policy of seven days prior to the event, which works for us. Please send over the contract at your earliest convenience so we can finalize everything.  

Best regards,  
Rebecca
