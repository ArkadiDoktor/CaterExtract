Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala on April 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. Our expertise lies in providing high-quality, kosher catering, and we ensure all food is under the supervision of the Kashrut Authority.  

For the gala, we typically recommend a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options. Our pricing is structured at a fixed rate of $75 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and up to 250 guests. Additionally, we can offer dietary accommodations for vegetarian and gluten-free guests upon request.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific menu items in mind.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details provided. The price point seems reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss a few adjustments. We are looking at around 150 guests, but we would also like to explore some options for a bar service. Is that something you can provide? Additionally, could you clarify if the $75 includes both the food and the beverages?  

I’d also appreciate a sample menu to see what dishes you recommend for a gala setting.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I can certainly provide a bar service; however, it would be at an additional cost, as our base price of $75 only covers the food. For the bar, we typically charge around $25 per person, which includes a selection of beer, wine, and soft drinks.  

As for the menu, I would suggest a few highlights such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled salmon, and a variety of seasonal salads. I will send over a detailed sample menu shortly for your review.  

Please let me know your thoughts on the bar service and if you’d like to proceed with the proposed adjustments.  

Warm regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying the details regarding the bar service. I appreciate the menu suggestions and would like to move forward with the catering for 150 guests, which includes the food for $75 per person plus the bar at $25 per person. That brings the total to $15,000, including VAT.  

I would also like to confirm that we will need a cancellation policy in place, ideally allowing for a full refund up to two weeks before the event in the event of unforeseen circumstances.  

Please proceed with the arrangements, and feel free to send the detailed menu when you can.  

Best,
