Dear Jessica,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate gala on November 15. We specialize in providing high-quality food and service for events like yours.  

Our catering packages typically range from $50 to $80 per person, depending on the menu selections and guest count. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and up to 300 guests, ensuring that we have the capacity to meet your needs.  

I want to confirm that all our food is kosher, under the supervision of the local Kashrut authority. We offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and dairy options, along with pareve dishes to cater to various dietary preferences. Additionally, we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options as requested.  

We also offer bar services, which can be included for an additional fee. Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or have any other questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Dear Aaron,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the detailed information about the catering options. I am particularly interested in the range of $60 per person, as it fits our budget better. However, I would like to clarify whether that price includes VAT or if it will be added later.  

Additionally, could you provide a few examples of menu items that you typically offer within that price point? We are also considering whether we want a full bar, so any details on that would be helpful.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Jessica,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The price of $60 per person does include VAT, so there won't be any surprises there. As for the menu, we typically offer dishes such as herb-crusted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a selection of seasonal salads. For dessert, we could provide a chocolate mousse and a fruit tart.  

Regarding the bar, we can certainly offer a full bar service at an additional cost of $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and cocktails. If you decide to go that route, we can set up the bar to ensure a smooth flow during the event.  

Please let me know your thoughts on these options.  

Best wishes,

This brings the final price to $9,000. I appreciate that you can accommodate our dietary options and that the food will be kosher.  

Additionally, I would like to include the full bar service for an additional $20 per person, which brings the total to $15,000. Please confirm the cancellation terms and any additional details regarding setup and staffing.  

Looking forward to finalizing this.
