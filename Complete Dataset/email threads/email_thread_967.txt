Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering services for your upcoming conference on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to the needs of our clients.  

For your event, we suggest a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and vegetarian options, ensuring that all dietary preferences are accommodated. We can offer a selection of dishes such as grilled chicken skewers, roasted vegetable platters, and an assortment of seasonal salads. We also provide kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Our pricing structure is based on a fixed rate of £35 per person, which includes VAT. We typically cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Please let me know if you require any beverages or a bar service, as those can be arranged separately.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the mixed menu you suggested, and the kosher supervision is a must for us. However, we are expecting around 200 attendees, which exceeds your maximum capacity. Would you be able to increase your guest capacity for this event?  

Also, can you provide options for dietary accommodations, particularly for gluten-free and vegan guests? Lastly, could you let me know if the price of £35 per person includes beverages or if that would be an additional charge?  

Thanks again, and I look forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can certainly increase our capacity to accommodate a maximum of 200 guests. Regarding dietary options, we can provide gluten-free and vegan dishes upon request.  

As for the beverages, the £35 per person price does not include drinks; we can offer a bar service at an additional cost of £15 per person. If you would prefer a package that includes both food and drinks, I can prepare a comprehensive proposal for that as well.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best wishes,

Hi David,  

Thank you for adjusting the capacity and providing the additional dietary options. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to confirm the catering for 200 guests at the rate of £35 per person, which brings the total to £7,000. Please include the bar service in the final proposal, making the grand total £8,500.  

I also want to confirm that the food will be kosher, under the Orthodox Union supervision, and that we will need a detailed cancellation policy in case anything changes. Please prepare the finalized agreement at your earliest convenience.  

Looking forward to working together.  

Best,
