Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception scheduled for October 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion.  

Our offerings include a variety of menu options tailored to your needs, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. We can accommodate dietary requirements, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Our pricing structure is typically set at $75 per person, which includes setup and staffing. We usually cater to a minimum of 50 guests, with a maximum of 150 guests. Please note that this price includes VAT.  

Additionally, all our food is kosher, supervised by the OK Kosher certification. We can also provide a bar service if you would like that included.  

Let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you would like to discuss further details.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The details sound promising. I do have a few questions regarding the menu options. Could you provide some examples of the dishes included in the mixed menu? Additionally, while I appreciate the $75 per person rate, we are hoping to stay within a budget of around $65 per person. Is there any flexibility on your part?  

Also, I wanted to confirm that the bar service would be an additional cost, as I understand it’s not included in the per person rate.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand the need to stay within budget. I can offer a modified menu that would bring the price down to $65 per person while still providing a satisfying experience. For example, we could serve brisket, roasted seasonal vegetables, and a pasta primavera, along with a salad and dessert options.  

Regarding the bar service, you are correct that this would be an additional expense. We can provide a full bar package starting at $30 per person, but I can also offer a limited selection of wines and beers if that would work better for your budget.  

Please let me know if this revised proposal suits your needs, and we can finalize the details.  

Best wishes,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for the revised menu options. I think the changes work well for us, and I am happy to proceed at the $65 per person rate for the catering. However, we will need to discuss the bar options further, as we may opt for the limited selection to keep costs manageable.  

Please confirm that the total catering price will be $6,500 for 100 guests, including VAT, and that we can finalize this agreement as per our discussed terms. I understand that cancellations need to be made at least two weeks in advance.  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can move forward.  

Best regards,
