Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala event on December 15th. We would be delighted to assist you with this occasion. Our team specializes in providing high-quality food tailored to your needs.  

For a gala of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu that includes a selection of meat and vegetarian dishes. Our pricing starts at 50 dollars per person, and we can accommodate between 100 and 200 guests. We ensure that all our food is kosher, supervised under the Orthodox Union, and we can also cater to specific dietary requirements if needed.  

Please let me know if you are interested in a tasting session, and we can discuss the details further.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

I appreciate your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds great, but I wanted to clarify a few details. While the starting price is within our budget, we were hoping to finalize a fixed price for the event. Would you be able to work with a total of 8,000 dollars for 150 guests? Additionally, could you confirm if the bar services are included in that price?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your quick response and for your interest in our services. I can confirm that we can offer a fixed price of 8,000 dollars for 150 guests, which includes a variety of dishes such as herb-marinated chicken and roasted seasonal vegetables. However, I must clarify that bar services are not included in that price and would be an additional cost.  

Let me know if that works for you, and we can proceed with the arrangements.  

Warm regards,
