Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for outlining the details. I appreciate the flexibility in accommodating dietary needs. However, we were hoping to keep the budget a bit lower. Would you be able to adjust the pricing to $40 per person? We expect around 100 guests, but we would like to confirm the final number closer to the date.  

Additionally, could you clarify whether beverages are included in the package? It would also be helpful to see some sample menu items.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I understand your budget concerns, and I can offer a revised price of $42 per person for the gala dinner. This price includes a selection of appetizers, two main courses, and dessert. However, beverages would be an additional cost, priced separately at $15 per person.  

As for the menu, I can provide options such as grilled salmon, roasted vegetable pasta, and a delectable chocolate mousse for dessert. Please let me know if this works for you.
