Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I would be thrilled to assist you with this event.  

For a gathering of this nature, we offer a mixed menu that includes a selection of meat and vegetarian options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests and provide a range of dishes, including herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable tart, and a delightful assortment of desserts.  

We also provide a full setup with all necessary equipment, staffing, and service during the event. However, please note that our package does not include a bar; we can offer beverage options separately if you wish.  

Let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I would be glad to tailor the menu accordingly. Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your quick response and for the detailed proposal. The menu options sound wonderful, and I appreciate the kosher supervision; however, I wanted to clarify a couple of points.  

Considering our budget constraints, would you be able to reduce the price to £40 per person? If we could finalize at that rate, I think we could confirm for around 100 guests. Also, could you accommodate some gluten-free options?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the importance of working within your budget. I can agree to the rate of £40 per person for the 100 guests, which brings the total to £4,000. This includes VAT. We can certainly provide gluten-free options as part of the menu.  

Please note that our cancellation policy allows for full refunds up to one week before the event, should any changes arise. Let me know if this works for you, and I will prepare the formal agreement.  

Best,
