Dear Hannah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming event. We would be delighted to provide catering services. We specialize in a variety of menus, including kosher options, and can accommodate different dietary needs.  

Could you please provide me with the date of your event and an estimated number of guests? This will help us create a tailored proposal for you. Our pricing generally starts at twenty-five dollars per person for a mixed menu, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We also offer beverage packages if you're interested.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The event is scheduled for March 15th, and we expect about eighty guests, but we can have as few as sixty or as many as one hundred. I am particularly interested in your kosher options, especially since we will have several guests with dietary restrictions.  

Could you confirm if the twenty-five dollars per person includes VAT? Additionally, I would like to know what specific dishes would be included in the mixed menu. If possible, it would be great to have a bar package as well.  

Best,

Dear Hannah,  

Thank you for the additional details. Our kosher menu is supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards for your guests. The twenty-five dollars per person does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate.  

For a mixed menu, we can offer options like roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and a selection of salads and desserts. Our bar package can be added for an additional fifteen dollars per person, which includes a variety of wines and soft drinks.  

If we move forward, I would like to note that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks before the event date. Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to confirm the catering for eighty guests at a total of two thousand dollars, which includes the kosher mixed menu and the bar package, bringing our total to two thousand six hundred dollars with VAT included. Please proceed with the arrangements, and let me know what else you may need from my side.  

Looking forward to working together.
