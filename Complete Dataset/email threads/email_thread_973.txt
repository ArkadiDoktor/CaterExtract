Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your upcoming corporate gala on April 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services tailored to our clients' needs.  

For your event, we can offer a varied menu that includes options for meat and vegetarian dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150 guests. Our pricing is structured at $60 per person, which includes VAT, and covers the full catering service, including setup and staffing.  

I would love to discuss your specific requirements further, including any dietary accommodations that may be needed. Please let me know a suitable time for us to chat.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your swift response and for the details you've provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but I wanted to confirm if the $60 per person includes beverages, as we are considering a separate bar service. Additionally, we expect around 120 guests, but could you let me know if there's flexibility with the price if we reach that number?  

I appreciate that the food will be kosher, but could you provide more information on the types of dishes you typically offer? Lastly, what are your cancellation terms?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah Johnson

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $60 per person price does not include beverages, as we typically recommend a separate bar service for events. However, if you finalize booking for 120 guests, I can offer a reduced rate of $55 per person.  

Regarding the menu, we can provide a selection including grilled chicken, beef brisket, and a variety of vegetarian options like stuffed peppers and quinoa salads. As for cancellation, we require notice at least two weeks before the event for a full refund.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, and I would be happy to send over a detailed menu and contract.  

Warm regards,
