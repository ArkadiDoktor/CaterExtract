Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala on March 15th. We would love to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our team specializes in a variety of menus, and we can offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options. 

For pricing, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes all food preparation and setup. Please note that this price excludes beverages, but we can arrange a bar service for an additional fee. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests for this event. 

Our food is kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, and we are happy to cater to any dietary restrictions you may have. We also have flexible cancellation terms up to two weeks before the event. 

If you're interested, I can send you a sample menu along with some representative dishes we can offer.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Dear David,

Thank you for your detailed response regarding the catering for our gala. I appreciate the pricing information and the kosher certification. However, I was hoping to negotiate the price a bit lower, as our budget is quite tight. Would you consider $65 per person?

Additionally, I would like to confirm if the quoted price includes VAT or if that will be added on top. Lastly, could you provide some examples of dietary accommodations you can offer?

Thank you for your assistance.

Dear Sarah,

I understand your budget concerns, and I'm happy to adjust our pricing to $70 per person, which still allows us to provide high-quality food and service. This price does include VAT, so there won't be any surprises there.

Regarding dietary accommodations, we can easily cater to vegetarian and gluten-free guests, and we can discuss any specific needs if you provide us with a list of restrictions. 

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can send over a sample menu to finalize our agreement.

Warm regards,
