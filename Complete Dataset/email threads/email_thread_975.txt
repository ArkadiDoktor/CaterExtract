Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to assist you.  

For an event of this nature, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of exquisite dishes, including options for both meat and dairy. Our pricing starts at £45 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. Please let me know your expected guest count, and I can provide a more tailored proposal.  

We ensure that all our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the London Beth Din, and we can also accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Regarding beverages, our packages do not include a bar, but we can offer a range of drinks at an additional cost. VAT is included in our pricing, which simplifies the budgeting process.

Dear David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you’ve provided. I am planning for around 100 guests, and I am particularly interested in a menu that includes both meat and dairy options, as well as accommodations for vegetarian attendees.  

Could you let me know if there's flexibility in the pricing? I’d like to explore options that could bring the cost down to around £40 per person. Also, if I decide to include a bar, what would that entail in terms of pricing?  

Looking forward to your reply!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply and for sharing your guest count. I can certainly adjust the menu and pricing to meet your budget of £40 per person. We can simplify some of the courses while still ensuring a delightful experience for your guests.  

For the bar, we can provide a selection of wines and spirits for an additional £15 per person, which would include two hours of service. This would bring your total to £55 per person, inclusive of VAT.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the agreement.  

Best regards,
