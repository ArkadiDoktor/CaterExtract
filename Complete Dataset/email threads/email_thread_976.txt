Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The event will indeed have around 150 guests, and I appreciate the flexibility in menu options. However, I was hoping for a more specific final price. Could you provide me with a detailed menu suggestion that fits within a $60 per person budget? Also, could you clarify if the beverage services are included in that pricing, or would they be an additional cost?  

I look forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your continued interest. I can create a menu that fits within the $60 per person range. For this price, we can offer a selection that includes an appetizer platter, a choice of two main courses such as grilled chicken and roasted vegetables, and a dessert bar.  

Regarding beverages, we typically charge an additional $15 per person for a standard open bar service, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and non-alcoholic drinks. If you prefer, we can also offer a non-alcoholic package at a lower rate.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal contract.  

Warm regards,
