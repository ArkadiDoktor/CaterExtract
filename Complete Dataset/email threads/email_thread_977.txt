Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special event.  

For a gathering of 100 to 150 guests, we offer a mixed menu that includes a variety of meat and dairy options, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Rabbinical Council. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We can accommodate dietary restrictions with advance notice, ensuring that all guests feel included.  

We also offer a selection of beverages, though a full bar service would be an additional charge. Please let me know if you would like to discuss menu options or have any specific requests.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thanks for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided so far. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to reduce the cost a bit. Would you be able to offer a fixed price for the entire event rather than per person? We are expecting about 120 guests, but I’d like to keep our budget in check.  

Additionally, could you clarify if the bar service includes any specific types of drinks? I want to ensure we have a nice selection for our guests while staying within limits.  

Thanks again!  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I completely understand your concerns about the budget. For a fixed price, we could set it at £5,400 for 120 guests, which would still include the mixed menu with dietary options and VAT included. This would cover the setup and staff necessary for the event as well.  

Regarding the bar service, we can offer a limited selection of house wines and soft drinks as part of the package. If you would like a wider range of beverages, we could discuss that separately.  

Please let me know if this works for you.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the revised offer. The fixed price of £5,400 for 120 guests works perfectly for us, and I appreciate the inclusion of setup and staff. The limited bar selection sounds great; we can finalize the details later.  

Let’s proceed with this agreement. If you could send over a contract and any additional information about the next steps, that would be fantastic. I look forward to working together to make this gala a success!  

Best regards,
