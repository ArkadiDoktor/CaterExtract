Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. We are expecting around 150 guests and would like to explore the mixed menu option with kosher supervision. Before moving forward, could you clarify if the prices you mentioned include VAT? Also, are beverages included in that price, or would they be charged separately?  

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to finalizing the details.  

Best,

Hello Samantha,  

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. The pricing I provided does not include VAT, which will be added on top of the final invoice. For beverages, we offer packages that can be included, or we can keep them separate based on your preference. If you would like to include a bar, we can discuss a range of options to suit your event.  

Once we finalize the menu, I can provide a concrete total price. Please let me know if you have any specific dishes in mind; our popular options include herb-crusted salmon and a flavorful vegetable risotto.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarification. I would like to proceed with the mixed kosher menu with a bar included for our 150 guests. With VAT, I expect the total to be around $11,250. Please confirm this final price. Also, could you provide your cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to your confirmation so we can finalize the arrangements.  

Warm regards,
