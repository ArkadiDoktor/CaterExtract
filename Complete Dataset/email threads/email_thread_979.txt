Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on April 15th. We have a range of options available to suit various tastes and dietary requirements.  

Our standard menu features a delightful selection of both meat and dairy dishes, all prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Star-K. We can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options upon request.  

For pricing, we typically charge $85 per person, which includes setup and service staff. This price covers a minimum of 50 guests, and we can cater up to 150. Please note that VAT is included in this price. If you are interested, I can send you a sample menu with highlights such as honey-glazed chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of gourmet desserts.  

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  

Best regards,

Dear David,  

Thank you for the prompt response. The $85 per person rate sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to discuss the possibility of lowering it a bit, given that we are expecting around 100 guests. Is there any flexibility in that pricing?  

Additionally, could you clarify if beverages are included in that price? We are considering having a separate bar service, so it would be helpful to know what to expect.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For a group of 100 guests, we can reduce the price to $80 per person, which still includes the setup and service staff. However, the beverage service is not included in that price. We can provide a bar package at an additional cost.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a detailed menu and bar options for your review.  

Best,

Dear David,  

Thank you for the revised offer of $80 per person for 100 guests. I’m pleased to move forward with your proposal. Please include the bar service options in your next message, and I would appreciate a detailed menu as well.  

Just to confirm, we will require kosher meals under the Star-K supervision, and I will let you know of any specific dietary requirements as we finalize the guest list. I believe this will be a beautiful event, and I look forward to working with you.
