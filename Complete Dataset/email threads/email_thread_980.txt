Dear Emily,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming corporate retreat scheduled for December 10th. We specialize in providing delicious meals that can accommodate various dietary needs, and I believe we can create a menu that will impress your attendees.  

For a group of between 50 and 100 guests, our pricing starts at $35 per person, which includes a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian options. We can also offer kosher meals under the supervision of the local rabbinical council. Additionally, beverages can be included for an extra charge if you’re interested.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requests.  

Best regards,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details about your services. I wanted to clarify a few things regarding the pricing. The $35 per person is a bit above our budget, and I was hoping we could discuss options to bring the cost down, especially if we have around 80 guests.  

Also, could you confirm whether the $35 includes VAT? It would be helpful to know if we can include some beverages in this package or if we would need to factor that in separately.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,

Hello Emily,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your concerns about pricing. For a group of 80 guests, I can reduce the per person cost to $30, which would bring the total to $2,400. This price includes VAT, but beverages would be additional unless you opt for our standard package, which includes soft drinks and coffee for an extra $500.  

Our menu can feature dishes like roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, and a selection of salads, all tailored to meet your kosher requirements. Please let me know if this adjustment works for you.  

Best,

Hi Jonathan,  

Thank you for your adjustments. The new price of $2,400 for 80 guests works for us, and I appreciate the clarity regarding the VAT and beverage options. I would like to move forward with the proposal. Please confirm the menu choices one more time, and let’s discuss the setup details and cancellation policy.  

Thanks again for your assistance.
