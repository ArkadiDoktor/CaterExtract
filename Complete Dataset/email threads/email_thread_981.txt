Dear Emily,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to Gourmet Delights regarding your upcoming wedding reception on June 15th. We would love to cater this special occasion for you.  

Our pricing is typically set at £50 per guest, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can accommodate between 80 and 120 guests. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision, certified by the London Beth Din. We can offer a mixed menu, featuring both meat and dairy options, and we can also cater to specific dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.  

Please note that our pricing includes VAT, and we can provide a beverage package if desired, although it is not included in the standard menu.  

Let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you would like to discuss further.  

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The pricing seems reasonable, but I am hoping to keep costs down a bit. Is there any flexibility on the per-guest price? Additionally, I would like to clarify if the £50 includes the service staff and equipment setup for the event, or if that is an additional charge.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Emily,  

I appreciate your feedback. While our standard rate is £50 per person, I can offer a reduced price of £45 per guest if we finalize the agreement by the end of this week. This rate includes service staff and equipment setup as part of the package.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the details.  

Warm regards,
