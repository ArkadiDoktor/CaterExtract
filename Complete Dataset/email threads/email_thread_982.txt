Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this occasion. Our team specializes in creating bespoke menus tailored to your needs.  

For an event of this nature, we generally recommend a mixed menu, which can include a variety of meat and dairy options. Our pricing structure is typically based on a per-person rate of $45, which includes all food items and setup. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests for this event.  

Additionally, all of our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, ensuring adherence to dietary laws. If you would like, we can also provide beverage options, although they are usually priced separately.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu in more detail or if you have any specific dietary needs for your guests.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. Given that we expect about 100 guests, I would like to confirm if the $45 per person rate includes VAT or if that will be added on top.  

Additionally, we would like to explore some vegetarian options within the menu since we may have a few guests with dietary restrictions. Could you also clarify your cancellation policy, just in case we need to adjust our plans?  

I’m looking forward to hearing from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $45 per person rate does include VAT, so there won't be any additional charges for tax. I can certainly offer a selection of vegetarian dishes to accommodate your guests, ensuring everyone has a delightful dining experience.  

Regarding our cancellation policy, we typically require at least 14 days' notice for any cancellations to avoid a charge. Should you wish to go ahead, we can finalize a menu that aligns with your needs.  

Please let me know if you need further clarification or if you’re ready to move forward.  

Best,
