Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss catering options for your upcoming charity gala on March 15th. We specialize in a variety of cuisines and can offer a diverse menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring that all guests have something delicious to enjoy.  

Our pricing structure is set at £35 per person, which includes a full three-course meal, along with a selection of beverages. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, so please let me know your expected numbers. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din, and we can provide vegetarian and gluten-free options if needed.  

Additionally, we'd be happy to discuss setup, staffing, and any equipment rentals you might require. Please let me know if you would like to schedule a call to go over the details.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the information provided. The pricing seems reasonable, but we are looking to stay within a budget of £30 per person, if possible. Would you be able to adjust the menu to meet this figure?  

Also, I wanted to clarify if the £35 price includes VAT or if that would be an additional cost. We are expecting around 120 guests, and I appreciate your flexibility in dietary accommodations.  

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for getting back to me. I understand your budget constraints, and I can offer a slightly modified menu that would bring the price down to £30 per person while still providing a delightful experience. This adjusted menu will maintain a quality standard, but may include fewer options for the main course.  

The £35 pricing I initially quoted does not include VAT, which would be added at the standard rate. I can assure you that we will handle all dietary requests, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. If you decide to proceed, we can finalize everything and discuss cancellation terms, which are typically 14 days prior to the event.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can move forward with the details.  

Best,
