Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the inclusion of dietary options. However, I noticed that the price of £30 per person might be a bit high given our budget constraints. Is there any flexibility in that figure?  

Additionally, could you clarify if the food is kosher and under what supervision? Our guests value this aspect, so it’s crucial for us. Lastly, does this price include beverages or will those be an extra cost?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. I understand the need to manage costs, and I can adjust the price to £25 per person if we simplify the menu slightly while still offering a wide selection.  

Regarding your inquiry about kosher food, yes, all our dishes can be prepared under strict supervision from the London Beth Din. As for beverages, they are not included in the initial price but can be arranged separately based on your preferences.  

I hope this helps, and I look forward to finalizing the details soon.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for accommodating my request and for clarifying the kosher supervision details. I would like to proceed with the £25 per person option for a minimum of 50 guests. This brings the total to £1,250, and I appreciate that VAT is included. Please confirm that beverages will be arranged separately.  

I understand the cancellation terms are flexible up until one week before the event, which works for us. I look forward to receiving the final menu and any additional setup information.  

Best regards,
