Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on July 15th. We specialize in a variety of menus and would be delighted to work with you to create a memorable dining experience for your guests.  

Our pricing typically starts at $50 per person, depending on the menu selection and any special dietary accommodations you may need. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. All of our food is kosher, supervised by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific dishes in mind.

Dear David,  

I appreciate your quick response and the details you've provided. I am particularly interested in your mixed menu options, as we have guests with varying preferences. However, I was hoping to explore if you could offer a fixed price for the entire event rather than a per person charge, as this would make budgeting easier.  

Also, could you clarify if the $50 per person includes VAT? Lastly, I need to confirm that you can accommodate a gluten-free option for some of our guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the need for a fixed price and would be happy to offer a package deal. For your event, we can provide a complete catering service for $7,500, which would cover up to 150 guests. This price includes VAT.  

We can certainly accommodate gluten-free options alongside our menu, ensuring all dietary needs are met. Please let me know if you would like to finalize the menu selections and any additional details.  

Best wishes,
