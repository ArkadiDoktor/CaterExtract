Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the catering services for your corporate gala scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality, kosher meals supervised by the Orthodox Union, and I believe we can create a delightful culinary experience for your guests.  

Our pricing structure is typically around $50 per person, which includes a three-course meal. We can accommodate a minimum of 100 guests and a maximum of 200. All prices include VAT. For your event, I recommend a mixed menu featuring options such as herb-roasted chicken, vegan stuffed peppers, and a selection of seasonal salads.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any specific dietary requirements or if you have any questions.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu options you provided sound appealing. However, we are considering a few adjustments, including ensuring that there are more vegetarian options available and perhaps adding some classic desserts.  

I also wanted to confirm that beverages are not included in the initial price you quoted. Could you provide any alternatives for a bar service and associated costs? Lastly, we expect around 150 guests, so could you let me know if there’s flexibility on pricing if we finalize the guest count soon?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I can certainly adjust the menu to include more vegetarian dishes and classic desserts, such as chocolate mousse and fruit tarts. For beverages, we can offer a bar service at an additional cost of $15 per person, which would include a selection of wines and soft drinks.  

Regarding the pricing for 150 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $7,200, which would maintain the quality of service and menu options. The cancellation policy allows for changes up to two weeks before the event without any fees.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I would be happy to finalize the details.
