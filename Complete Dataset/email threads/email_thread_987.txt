Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on May 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality food services for events like yours. Based on the details you've shared, I would recommend a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options, ensuring we cater to a variety of dietary preferences.  

For pricing, our standard rate is $65 per person, which includes VAT. We typically accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and can serve up to 200. Our team will provide all necessary setup and staffing, ensuring a seamless experience for your attendees. Additionally, we can offer kosher options under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, if that aligns with your needs.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing seems reasonable, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit. Given that we might have around 150 guests, could you offer a discount for that number? Also, I wanted to clarify whether the $65 includes a full bar service or if beverages are charged separately.  

Additionally, could you provide some sample dishes from the proposed menu? I want to ensure we have options that will appeal to our diverse group.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your interest and understand the need to manage costs effectively. For your event of 150 guests, I can offer a revised rate of $60 per person. This includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, but please note that a full bar service would be an additional $15 per person.  

As for the menu, we can include dishes such as grilled salmon, stuffed portobello mushrooms, and a variety of seasonal salads. We can certainly accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I’ll be happy to finalize the details.  

Best wishes,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your flexibility with the pricing and for providing the menu highlights. I’m pleased to accept the offer of $60 per person for 150 guests. This will total $9,000, including VAT, and I appreciate the detail on dietary accommodations. Please ensure that the menu is kosher under the Orthodox Union supervision.  

We will proceed without a bar service for now, but I may reconsider that later. Regarding cancellation, could you please confirm the terms?  

Looking forward to finalizing everything soon.  

Best,
