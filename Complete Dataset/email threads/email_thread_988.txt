Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Corporate Event  

Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding your request for catering services for the corporate event scheduled on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for various occasions, and I believe we can offer a package that suits your needs.  

For this event, I suggest a mixed menu featuring a selection of meat and dairy options. Our pricing starts at $40 per person, which includes a variety of dishes, such as grilled chicken, pasta primavera, and a seasonal salad. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our prices include VAT.  

Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements or preferences, and I would be happy to tailor the menu accordingly. Additionally, we can provide a full bar service for an extra cost if you’re interested.  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the proposal. The mixed menu sounds appealing, but I was hoping to get the price per person down a bit, especially if we end up with closer to the 150 guests. Would you be willing to adjust the pricing? Also, could you confirm whether the food will be kosher and what supervision you offer?  

Lastly, we are considering including drinks, so if you could provide a ballpark figure for that, it would be helpful.  

Thanks,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick reply. I can offer a revised price of $35 per person if we reach the maximum of 150 guests. Our meals are kosher, supervised by the Rabbinical Council, ensuring everything meets the necessary standards. For the bar service, we can provide a selection of wines and spirits for an additional $15 per person.  

If this works for you, I can prepare a formal contract. Just a reminder, our cancellation policy is 72 hours before the event for a full refund. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.
