Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. The menu options sound wonderful. However, I wanted to clarify if beverages are included in the catering package. Additionally, would it be possible to adjust the price if we end up having closer to 150 guests? 

If we move forward, I would like to finalize everything by the end of this week.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. Our standard package does not include beverages, but we can certainly add a bar service for an additional fee. Regarding the guest count, if you confirm 150 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $6,750 which includes everything we discussed. 

Please consider that our cancellation policy requires at least two weeks' notice to avoid any charges. Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the agreement.  

Best,
