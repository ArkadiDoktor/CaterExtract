Hi David,

Thank you for your prompt reply and the detailed proposal. I'm excited about the options you mentioned. However, I would like to discuss the pricing a bit more. Given our budget constraints, would you be able to offer a reduced rate if we end up with around 75 guests? Additionally, could you confirm whether the $75 per person includes VAT or if it will be added on top?

I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your response. I completely understand your budget considerations. For a guest count of 75, we can offer a revised rate of $70 per person, which still includes VAT. This price covers a diverse menu, featuring dishes such as herb-roasted chicken and seasonal vegetable lasagna. We can also provide gluten-free options if needed.

Please let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare a formal agreement. Our cancellation policy allows for full refunds if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Warm regards,
