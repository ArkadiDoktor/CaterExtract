Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming wedding reception on May 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. We specialize in kosher cuisine, closely supervised by the Orthodox Union, and our menu features a delightful range of meat and dairy dishes.  

For an event of this nature, we typically charge $75 per person, which includes a variety of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Our packages can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests. This price includes VAT. Please note that beverages are not included but can be provided for an additional fee.  

We can also cater to dietary preferences, including vegetarian and gluten-free options, to ensure all your guests are satisfied. We will handle the setup and staffing on the day of the event.  

I look forward to discussing this further.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. Before we proceed, I wanted to clarify a few points. Is there any flexibility in the pricing if we decide to have a smaller guest count, say around 90 guests? Additionally, could you provide some examples of the dishes included in the menu? I want to ensure we have a good variety for our guests.  

I am also curious about the cancellation policy should anything change as we get closer to the date.  

Thank you again for your assistance.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. I completely understand your concerns. For a guest count of 90, we can adjust the price to $70 per person, which still includes VAT. As for the menu, we typically offer dishes like herb-roasted chicken, beef brisket, and a variety of seasonal vegetables, along with a selection of kosher desserts.  

Regarding cancellation, we have a policy that allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event. After that, we can offer a partial refund up until one week before the event.  

Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
