Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us at Gourmet Events. We would be delighted to cater your upcoming gala dinner on November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality kosher meals, and I can assure you that all our dishes are under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we can offer a mixed menu featuring a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Our pricing structure is set at $75 per person, which includes VAT. The minimum number of guests we can accommodate is 50, while we can serve up to 150. Please let me know if you have any specific dietary requirements, and we will do our best to accommodate them.  

Additionally, we can provide a full bar service for an extra charge. I look forward to discussing this further with you.  

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for the prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. I would like to confirm that we can expect a guest count closer to 100. Could you clarify if the $75 per person price includes all service staff and equipment setup? Also, if we were to add the bar service, could you provide a rough estimate of that cost? Lastly, we might need some vegetarian options available for a few guests.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person price does indeed cover all service staff and equipment setup. For the bar service, we typically charge an additional $15 per person, which would bring the total to $90 per person if you choose to include it. We can certainly offer vegetarian options as part of the menu to accommodate your guests.  

Please let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for clarifying the details. The total of $90 per person, including the bar service and vegetarian options, sounds good to me. I would like to proceed with the catering for 100 guests for the gala on November 15th. Could you please send over the contract and include the cancellation policy?  

Looking forward to finalizing this.  

Best,
