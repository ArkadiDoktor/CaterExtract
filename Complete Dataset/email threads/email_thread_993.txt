Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th at the Riverside Banquet Hall. We would be delighted to assist in making your special day memorable.  

We offer a variety of menus tailored to different tastes and dietary needs. Our most popular package is a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options, including dishes such as herb-roasted chicken, grilled vegetable lasagna, and a selection of gourmet salads.  

Our pricing structure is based on a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes full service and setup. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests and are fully equipped to handle any dietary restrictions your guests may have. Additionally, all our food is kosher and prepared under the supervision of the Orthodox Union.  

Please let me know if this aligns with your vision, and we can discuss further details, including beverage options and any other specific requests you might have.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision. However, I would like to clarify if the $75 per person price includes VAT or if it will be added later. Additionally, we are considering a more formal setup, and I wanted to know if your service includes a bar, or if we would need to arrange that separately.  

I look forward to your reply so we can finalize everything soon.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your questions. The $75 per person does include VAT, so there are no hidden costs. Unfortunately, the price does not cover a bar service, but we can help arrange a beverage package if you would like me to provide some options.  

If you decide to go ahead with our catering, please note our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled more than three weeks prior to the event date.  

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  

Warm regards,

We will manage the bar separately, but please send over any beverage package options you have available.
