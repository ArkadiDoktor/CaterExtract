Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate event on November 15th. We would love to assist you with this. We specialize in a diverse menu that includes options for various dietary needs. Our offering can be tailored to fit a range of budgets, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests.  

Our pricing structure is typically around $45 per person, which includes a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian dishes. We ensure that all food is prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, and we can provide additional dietary accommodations as needed.   

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or arrange a tasting.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the information regarding the menu and pricing. Since we expect around 100 guests, could you clarify if the $45 per person includes VAT or if that will be added on top? Additionally, we are considering whether to include beverages; could you provide options for that as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I’m glad to hear back from you. The price of $45 per person does not include VAT, which will be added at the standard rate. Regarding beverages, we can offer a bar package that includes soft drinks and a selection of wines for an additional $15 per person. If you prefer not to include a bar, we can provide a non-alcoholic beverage station at no extra cost.  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and we can finalize the menu selections as well.  

Best,

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for clarifying the pricing and beverage options. I would like to confirm the catering for 100 guests with the mixed menu at $45 per person, plus VAT, and we will also include the bar package for an additional $15 per person. This brings the total to $6,000.  

Please confirm this arrangement, and I will send over a deposit to secure the booking. I understand the cancellation policy is 14 days prior to the event, which works for us.  

Best regards,
