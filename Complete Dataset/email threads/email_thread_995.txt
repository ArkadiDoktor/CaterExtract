Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed menu options. I appreciate the kosher supervision, but we have a few concerns regarding the pricing. For our budget, we were hoping to stay closer to $60 per person. Additionally, could you clarify if this price includes VAT and whether beverages are part of the package?  

I look forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. I understand your budget concerns. While the standard price is $75 per person, I can offer a special rate of $65 per person if we can confirm the minimum of 50 guests. This rate includes VAT, but beverages would be an additional charge.  

Please let me know if this works for you, or if you’d like to explore different menu options or quantities.  

Warm regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,  

I appreciate your willingness to adjust the pricing. I can confirm the special rate of $65 per person for 50 guests. Please proceed with the arrangement, and ensure the menu includes both meat and vegetarian options to accommodate all our guests. I understand that beverages will be extra, and we will finalize those details later.  

Also, could you please confirm the cancellation policy? Looking forward to a successful event with your catering.
