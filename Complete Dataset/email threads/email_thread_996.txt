Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services for this special occasion. Our menu features a diverse selection of dishes, including both meat and dairy options, to accommodate various tastes.  

We typically charge a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes a full buffet setup, staff for service, and all necessary equipment. For your event, we can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200 guests. Please note that this price is exclusive of VAT, which is charged at 20%.  

If your guests require any dietary accommodations, we can certainly discuss options such as gluten-free and vegetarian meals. Additionally, our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Star-K organization.  

I would be happy to send over a sample menu and discuss any other details you might need.

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details regarding the pricing and menu options. The $75 per person sounds reasonable; however, I was hoping to negotiate a bit on the price, considering we might have around 150 guests. Would you be willing to discuss a possible discount if we confirm by the end of this week?  

Also, could you clarify whether the bar service is included in that price? We are considering offering some drinks but would like to understand the options better.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your feedback and understand your concerns regarding the pricing. For a confirmed guest count of 150, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person. However, please note that the bar service is not included in this price. We can provide various beverage packages at an additional cost, should you choose to include them.  

Let me know if this adjusted pricing works for you, and I can prepare a detailed proposal, including the beverage options.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your flexibility on the pricing. I am happy to confirm the catering for 150 guests at $70 per person, totaling $10,500. Please include the bar service in your proposal, as we would like to offer a selection of drinks.  

I also want to confirm that we understand the cancellation policy and that VAT will be added on top of the final price. Please send over the finalized details, and we can proceed from there.
