Dear Rachel,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming corporate gala on October 15. We specialize in providing high-quality meals for such events and would love to assist you.  

Our catering options typically include a variety of dishes, from gourmet appetizers to main courses and desserts. We can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 200. The pricing structure is generally set at $45 per person, which includes VAT. Our menu can be tailored to suit your needs, including kosher options under the supervision of the Star-K, should that be necessary.  

Additionally, we can provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar would be an additional service. Please let me know if you have any dietary preferences or specific menu items you would like to discuss.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response and for the details regarding your catering services. The pricing seems reasonable, but could you clarify if the $45 per person includes the beverages, or if that would be an extra charge? Also, we might have around 150 guests, so I would appreciate any suggestions for a mixed menu that could include vegetarian options.  

Additionally, please let me know your cancellation policy, as I want to ensure we have that covered.  

Best,

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your questions. The $45 per person does not include the bar, which would be an additional cost depending on the selections you choose. For a mixed menu, I can certainly include options such as grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a selection of pastas that cater to vegetarian diets.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we offer a full refund if canceled at least 14 days prior to the event. If it’s within that timeframe, we can discuss a partial refund depending on the circumstances.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement, and I can prepare a formal agreement.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for clarifying those details. I would like to confirm our order for 150 guests with the mixed menu, including the vegetarian options. The total comes to $6,750, which I understand includes VAT. Please prepare the formal agreement, and let's ensure we have everything in place well before the 14-day mark for cancellation.  

Looking forward to a successful event!
