Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Events for your catering needs. I understand you are planning a wedding reception on November 15, and we would be delighted to provide our services.  

We specialize in a mixed menu, featuring a variety of dishes to suit different tastes. Our pricing is structured at $75 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 and 150 guests. This price includes VAT and covers a full buffet setup, staffing, and equipment. We can also provide kosher options under rabbinical supervision if required.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss specific menu items or if you have any dietary accommodations in mind. I look forward to hearing from you.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a couple of details. Are beverages included in your proposal, or would that be an additional cost? Also, we anticipate around 100 guests, but we might go up to 120, depending on the RSVPs.  

I appreciate your offer of kosher options. Can you confirm if the menu would be entirely meat-based or if you can accommodate some dairy dishes as well?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. Beverages are not included in the initial price but can be added for an additional $15 per person. Regarding the menu, we can certainly provide a selection of both meat and dairy dishes, along with pareve options to suit your guests’ needs.  

If you decide on 100 guests, the total would be $7,500, and if you reach the maximum of 120, it would be $9,000, both inclusive of VAT. I would recommend confirming the final guest count at least two weeks before the event to finalize the arrangements.  

Please let me know if you have any further queries or if you are ready to proceed.  

Best,  
David

Thank you for the detailed information. After discussing it with my fiancé, we are ready to proceed with the catering for 100 guests at the total price of $7,500. We would like to include a selection of both meat and dairy dishes, and we would also appreciate the addition of beverages for an extra $1,500.  

Please confirm if you can accommodate our requests and send over the contract at your earliest convenience. We are excited to work with you!  

Best regards,
