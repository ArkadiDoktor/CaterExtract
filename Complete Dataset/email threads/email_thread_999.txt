We offer a diverse menu that includes both meat and dairy options, ensuring that there is something for everyone. Our pricing structure is set at $45 per person, and we can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests. This price includes VAT, and we can provide kosher meals supervised by the local rabbinical council.  

In terms of beverages, we typically offer a bar service as an additional option. Please let me know if you would like to include that in your package. We can also cater to various dietary restrictions, including gluten-free and vegetarian options.

Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the detailed proposal. The menu sounds fantastic, and I appreciate the kosher certification.  

However, I would like to clarify a few things before moving forward. Is there any flexibility in the pricing if we decide to go with a larger guest count? Also, could you provide more details on the cancellation policy? I want to ensure we have everything in place, just in case.  

Looking forward to your reply.

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your inquiries. We can indeed offer a reduced price of $40 per person if your guest count exceeds 100 attendees. Regarding the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund, which gives you some peace of mind.  

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any further questions. I am eager to assist you in finalizing the details.
