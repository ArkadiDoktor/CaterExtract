Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is David Klein from Gourmet Delights Catering, and I’m reaching out regarding your upcoming corporate event scheduled for November 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality catering services and would be thrilled to assist you.  

For events like yours, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring a variety of meat and dairy options, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Rabbinical Council. We can accommodate between 50 to 150 guests, and our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate of $75, which includes VAT. We can also provide a selection of beverages, but that can be discussed further based on your preferences.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any specific requirements.  

Best regards,  
David Klein

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided regarding the menu and pricing. However, I was hoping to negotiate the per-person cost to fit within our budget. Would you be able to offer a revised rate of $65 per person? Additionally, we would like to know if you can provide alternatives for guests with dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free or vegan options.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your feedback. I understand the need to stay within budget, and I can offer you a revised rate of $70 per person, which includes VAT. We will also ensure that gluten-free and vegan options are available for those who need them.  

Please confirm if this works for you, and we can finalize the details, including the menu highlights. I also want to mention that our cancellation policy allows for a full refund if canceled at least two weeks prior to the event.
