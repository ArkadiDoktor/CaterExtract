Subject: Catering Proposal for Upcoming Wedding

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights Catering for your upcoming wedding on June 15th. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences, and I'd love to discuss how we can assist you on your special day.

For a wedding event, we typically offer a mixed menu featuring both meat and dairy options to accommodate diverse tastes. Our pricing structure is set at £45 per person, which includes VAT. We can cater for a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests. Additionally, we are able to provide kosher meals under the supervision of the London Beth Din.

As part of our service, we can also arrange for a selection of beverages, but please note that a full bar is not included in the base price. Some of our highlight dishes include herb-crusted lamb, roasted vegetable medley, and a selection of gourmet desserts.

I would be happy to discuss further details and any specific dietary options you may require. Please let me know a convenient time for us to connect.

Best regards,  
David Thompson

Hi David,

Thank you for your quick response and the detailed proposal. I appreciate the mixed menu option, and the kosher certification is important to us. However, I was hoping we could discuss the pricing a bit. Given our budget constraints, would it be possible to lower the price to £40 per person? 

Also, could you clarify whether the £45 includes all service charges and setup fees? We're expecting around 100 guests, but we might adjust the number, depending on RSVPs.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
