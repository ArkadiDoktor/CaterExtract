For your event, we offer a fixed price of $50 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. If you expect between 50 and 100 guests, we can certainly provide a delightful mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian options. All our food is prepared under strict kosher supervision from the Manchester Beth Din.

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds great, and I appreciate the kosher certification. I wanted to clarify whether the quoted price of $50 per person includes VAT, as well as if beverages are part of that package.

We are anticipating around 75 guests, and I would like to ensure we have enough variety to accommodate different dietary needs. Could you also provide some examples of the dishes included in the menu? Lastly, what are your cancellation terms?

Thanks,

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your questions. The price of $50 does not include VAT, which would be added on top of the base price. As for beverages, they are not included in the initial quote; however, we can provide a bar service for an additional $15 per person.

For the menu, I can suggest some popular options such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a selection of fresh salads. We can certainly accommodate gluten-free and vegan options upon request. Regarding cancellation, we offer a full refund if you cancel at least two weeks prior to the event.

Please let me know if this works for you.

Best,

Hi Michael,

Thank you for the details. I appreciate the clarification on pricing and the additional options for beverages. I would like to proceed with the catering for 75 guests at the total price of $3,750, including VAT. Please confirm that we will have a mixed menu with the mentioned dishes and the gluten-free option as well.

I will also need a staff member for setup and service during the event. If everything is in order, please send over the contract.
