Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The gala dinner sounds wonderful, and the kosher menu is a perfect fit for our attendees.  

I wanted to clarify if the $75 per person price includes any additional services for beverages, as we may want to consider a bar option. Also, could you provide a few examples of the dishes you typically serve?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Hello Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. The $75 per person does not include an alcoholic bar, but we can certainly arrange a full bar service at an additional cost. As for our menu, we typically serve dishes like herb-roasted chicken, braised short ribs, and a variety of seasonal salads. We can customize the menu based on your preferences.  

For the bar, I can provide a quote once we have a better idea of the drink selection you would prefer. Please let me know if you have a specific theme or style in mind.
