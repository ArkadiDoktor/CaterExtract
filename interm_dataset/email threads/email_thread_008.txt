Hi Daniel,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The pricing sounds reasonable, but could you clarify if the $45 per person includes beverages? Additionally, we are expecting around 100 guests and would like to ensure there are kosher options available. If possible, could you provide a sample menu with some highlighted dishes?  

Also, I’d like to confirm the cancellation policy should we need to make changes closer to the event date.  

Thanks again for your assistance!  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The $45 per person does not include beverages; however, we can offer a bar package for an additional $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines and soft drinks. Our kosher options are under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council, which ensures all dietary laws are followed.  

For the sample menu, we can include items such as herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, a selection of salads, and a variety of desserts. As for the cancellation policy, we require a two-week notice for any changes or cancellations to avoid any fees.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I can prepare the formal agreement.  

Best,
