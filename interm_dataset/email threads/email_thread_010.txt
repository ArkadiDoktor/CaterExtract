Our pricing typically ranges from 50 to 75 dollars per person, depending on the selected menu options. We can accommodate between 100 and 150 guests, and our dishes are all kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We can offer a mixed menu that includes meat and dairy options, as well as pareve dishes for dietary restrictions.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm excited about the possibility of working together. For our wedding, we'd like to finalize the guest count closer to the date, but I anticipate around 120 guests. Can you provide a more specific estimate based on that number?  

Additionally, could you clarify if the quoted prices include VAT? We would also like to know if the beverages are included in your proposal or if they are an additional cost. If possible, I would love to see a sample menu with some highlighted dishes to help us make a decision.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Sarah

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your follow-up. Based on your estimate of 120 guests, I can offer a fixed price of $65 per person, which includes VAT. Beverages are not included in that price; we can provide a separate bar package if you’re interested.  

As for the menu, I would recommend our popular dishes such as roasted chicken with herbs, herb-crusted salmon, and a variety of seasonal vegetarian options. We also accommodate for gluten-free and vegan diets as requested.  

If you confirm the guest count by April 1st, we can hold your date with a cancellation policy allowing changes up to two weeks before the event. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer.  

Best,  
David

Please confirm that the dishes you mentioned will be part of our selection.  

Let me know if you need a deposit to secure the booking. I look forward to working with you to make our wedding a wonderful event.
