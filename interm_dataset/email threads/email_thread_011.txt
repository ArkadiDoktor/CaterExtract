Thank you for considering Gourmet Delights for your catering needs. We are excited about the opportunity to provide exceptional food for your upcoming corporate gala on March 15th. We specialize in a mixed menu, featuring dishes such as herb-marinated chicken, roasted seasonal vegetables, and a selection of delectable desserts.  

Our pricing structure is based on a per-person rate, which starts at $45 and can be adjusted depending on your specific requirements. I should mention that this price includes VAT. We can accommodate between 50 to 200 guests and are pleased to offer dietary options, including vegetarian and gluten-free.  

Additionally, our team can assist with setup and staffing to ensure the event runs smoothly. Please let me know if you have any specific requests or questions.

Hi Michael,  

Thank you for the quick response. The menu sounds wonderful, but I would like to clarify a few details before proceeding. Can you confirm if the food will be kosher? If so, what level of supervision do you have?  

Also, we are considering adding a beverage package, perhaps a bar service, so I would appreciate your input on that and how it might affect pricing. Lastly, could you provide the cancellation terms in case our plans change?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

I appreciate your quick response. Yes, all our food is certified kosher under the supervision of the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest quality standards. Regarding the beverage service, we can offer a bar package starting at an additional $20 per person, which includes a selection of wines, beers, and soft drinks.  

As for the cancellation policy, we require a notice of at least 14 days prior to the event for a full refund. If you cancel after that, a 50% charge will apply.  

If all looks good, we can finalize the arrangement for 150 guests at a total of $9,750, which includes everything discussed.  

Best wishes,
