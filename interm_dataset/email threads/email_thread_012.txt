Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala event on June 15th. We would be delighted to provide catering services. Our offerings include a variety of menu options, and we can accommodate both kosher and non-kosher preferences. All our kosher meals are supervised by the Orthodox Union.  

For your event, we typically recommend a mixed menu that features a selection of meat and dairy dishes. Our pricing starts at $45 per person for a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150 guests. This price includes VAT.  

We can also provide a bar package upon request, although it is not included in the base catering price. Additionally, we are happy to offer dietary accommodations, such as vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

If you have any specific dishes in mind, please let us know, and we can create a tailored menu for your event.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The mixed menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the kosher supervision details. Considering the size of our guest list, we expect around 100 attendees. Could you confirm if the price would remain the same for this number?  

Additionally, I would like to inquire about the cancellation policy and if the bar package can be included at a discounted rate. We are keen on having both wine and cocktails during the event.  

Best,

Hi Rachel,  

I appreciate your interest in our catering services. For a guest count of 100, the price would remain at $45 per person, bringing the total to $4,500, which includes VAT.  

As for the bar package, we can offer a 15% discount if you decide to include it with the catering. Our cancellation policy states that cancellations made within 14 days of the event will incur a 50% charge of the total catering fee.  

Please let me know if this arrangement works for you, and we can finalize the details.  

Best,
