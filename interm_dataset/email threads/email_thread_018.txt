Dear Rachel,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your upcoming gala dinner on March 15th. We specialize in providing high-quality meals tailored to the needs of various events, and I believe we can help make your evening memorable.  

For a gathering of 50 to 100 guests, our pricing starts at £45 per person, which includes a three-course meal featuring a variety of options. We offer a mixed menu that includes both meat and vegetarian dishes, prepared under strict kosher supervision by the London Beth Din. If you would like us to provide beverages, we can arrange a bar service for an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you have specific dietary accommodations in mind, and I can provide more details on our offerings. I look forward to discussing this further with you soon.

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The price you mentioned sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to clarify a couple of things. Could you confirm whether the £45 per person price includes VAT? Additionally, could you provide a few examples of the dishes you would feature in the three-course meal?  

We are also considering the potential for 80 guests, but we might go as low as 60, depending on the final RSVPs. If we decide to include the bar, could you let me know the range of costs we might expect?  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,  
Rachel Thompson

Dear Rachel,  

I appreciate your follow-up. The £45 per person does not include VAT, which is charged at the standard rate. As for the menu, we typically offer selections such as a classic beef brisket, a creamy mushroom risotto for vegetarians, and a fresh salad with seasonal vegetables.  

If you opt for the bar, we can provide a selection of house wines and cocktails at an additional cost of around £15 per person, which would also need to be considered in your budget. I understand your guest count may vary, and we can accommodate anywhere from 60 to 100 guests comfortably.  

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the clarifications. After reviewing the details, I would like to proceed with the catering for 80 guests at £45 per person, making the total £3,600 plus VAT. I appreciate the menu options you've provided, and I'm confident they will impress our attendees.  

Could you please confirm that the food will be kosher under the supervision of the London Beth Din? Additionally, we will include the bar service for an extra £15 per person, bringing the total to £4,800 plus VAT.  

I would also like to discuss the cancellation policy to ensure everything is clear. Once we finalize these details, I'll be ready to move forward.  

Thank you for your assistance!  

Best,
