Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out regarding catering for your upcoming gala on December 10. We would be delighted to assist you with this event. We have extensive experience in providing catering services for similar gatherings, and I believe we can create a memorable culinary experience for your guests.  

Our pricing structure is typically around $75 per person, which includes a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. We can cater to a minimum of 50 guests and can comfortably accommodate up to 200. We also offer a mixed menu, featuring both meat and vegetarian options to cater to diverse dietary preferences. All of our meat is kosher, under the supervision of the local rabbinical authority.  

Please let me know if you have specific menu preferences or any dietary restrictions we should consider. Once we finalize the details, I can provide you with a detailed quote.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate the details you've provided. The pricing of $75 per person sounds reasonable, but I was hoping to explore if there's any flexibility in that rate, especially if we anticipate closer to 150 guests. Additionally, could you clarify if the price includes VAT?  

I am also interested in knowing if you provide beverages or if that would be an additional charge. Lastly, we want to ensure that our kosher requirements are strictly adhered to, so I would like to confirm the supervision details.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

I appreciate your follow-up. For groups of 150 or more, I can offer a reduced rate of $70 per person, which still includes VAT. As for beverages, we typically do not include them in our standard catering package, but we can certainly arrange a bar service at an additional cost.  

Regarding kosher supervision, all our meat dishes are certified kosher by Rabbi Levy, who oversees our kitchen operations, ensuring strict adherence to dietary laws. I hope this addresses your concerns.  

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this arrangement or if you have any other questions.  

Best,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your clarification and for accommodating the pricing for the larger guest count. I would like to confirm the catering for 150 guests at $70 per person, which includes VAT. The menu should have a mix of meat and vegetarian options, and we'll arrange for our own beverages, so that won’t be necessary.  

To summarize, we will proceed with the catering, and the total will be $10,500. Please provide a contract outlining the cancellation terms and any other necessary details.  

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to a successful event.
