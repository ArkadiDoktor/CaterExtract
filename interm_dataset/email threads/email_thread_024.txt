Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to us regarding catering for your event on December 15th. We would be delighted to assist with a delicious menu that meets your needs.  

For a gathering of up to 150 guests, we typically offer a range of options, including a mixed menu featuring both meat and vegetarian selections. Our pricing generally starts at $45 per person, which includes VAT, and we can accommodate dietary restrictions such as gluten-free and vegan diets.  

All our meals are prepared under strict kosher supervision by the Orthodox Union, ensuring the highest standards of quality. We can also provide a selection of beverages, though a full bar service would be an additional cost.  

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you'd like to discuss the details further. Looking forward to your reply.  

Best regards,

Hi Mark,  

Thank you for your prompt response and the information provided. I appreciate the kosher supervision, as it is essential for our guests. The $45 per person price point sounds reasonable, but is there any flexibility if we confirm a higher guest count? We are anticipating between 100 to 150 guests.  

Additionally, could you clarify what specific dishes might be included in the mixed menu? It would be helpful to understand the options available. I’d also like to confirm the cancellation policy you offer, just in case our numbers change closer to the date.  

Thanks again for your support, and I look forward to hearing back from you.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your reply. If you can confirm 150 guests, we can offer a reduced price of $42 per person, which still includes VAT. As for the menu, we typically include options like roasted chicken, herb-crusted salmon, and a variety of seasonal vegetables, along with salads and desserts.  

Regarding the cancellation policy, we allow changes or cancellations up to two weeks before the event without any penalty, which should provide some flexibility. If you have any other specific requests or concerns, please feel free to share.  

Looking forward to finalizing the details with you.
