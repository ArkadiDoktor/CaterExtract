Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your upcoming gala dinner scheduled for December 15th at the City Hall Banquet Room. We specialize in providing a diverse range of catering options and would be delighted to assist you.  

For a formal event like yours, we can offer a mixed menu, including appetizers, main courses, and desserts, with a focus on quality and presentation. Our pricing starts at $75 per person, which includes VAT, and we can accommodate a minimum of 50 guests and up to 150 guests.  

If you require kosher meals, we can provide that under the supervision of the Orthodox Union. We also offer a selection of beverages, though a full bar is not included in the base price.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the menu options further or if you have any specific dietary requirements to accommodate.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for your prompt response. The menu sounds promising, and I appreciate the kosher option. However, I need to clarify whether the $75 per person covers everything you mentioned, including setup and staffing, or if there are extra costs associated with those services.  

Additionally, we expect around 100 guests, but I would like to keep the option open for more if necessary. Could you also provide some sample dishes from the mixed menu? It would be helpful to visualize what we could offer.  

Looking forward to your reply.  

Best,

Dear Sarah,  

Thank you for your questions. The $75 per person indeed covers the menu, setup, and staffing for the event. However, if your guest count exceeds 100, we can accommodate up to 150 without increasing the base price. Regarding the menu, I can offer items such as grilled chicken with a Mediterranean glaze, roasted vegetable tart, and a selection of gourmet desserts, including chocolate mousse and fruit tarts.  

If you would like to include a full bar, we can arrange that for an additional fee. Please let me know how you wish to proceed, and I can send over the final proposal.  

Best regards,
