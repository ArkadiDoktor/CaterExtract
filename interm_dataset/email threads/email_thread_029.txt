Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to provide you with catering options for the gala dinner you are organizing on December 10th at The Grand Hall. We specialize in creating memorable dining experiences and would love to help make your event a success.  

For a mixed menu, we suggest a selection of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, highlighting dishes such as herb-crusted salmon, roasted vegetable lasagna, and a decadent chocolate mousse. Our pricing structure is set at a fixed price of $75 per person, which includes all food, setup, and staffing, with a minimum of 50 guests and a maximum of 150.  

Please note that our menus can accommodate dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free options. All food served is kosher, supervised under the Orthodox Union. However, beverages and bar services are not included in this price but can be arranged separately if desired.  

Let me know if you would like to discuss this further or have any specific preferences.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the detailed proposal. The menu sounds appealing, and I appreciate the information regarding dietary accommodations and kosher supervision. However, we were hoping to stay within a budget of around $65 per person. Would it be possible to adjust the menu or pricing to meet this figure?  

Additionally, could you confirm whether the $75 price includes VAT or if that would be added on top?  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best,

Hi Sarah,  

Thank you for your prompt reply. I understand your budget concerns, and I can offer a revised menu that retains the essence of our original proposal. We can adjust the selections to include options like chicken piccata and a seasonal vegetable stir-fry, bringing the price down to $65 per person. This price does include VAT, so there won’t be any additional charges.  

Let me know if this works for you, and I will send over a formal agreement.  

Best regards,

Hi David,  

Thank you for the adjustment and for clarifying the pricing. I would like to move forward with the revised menu at $65 per person for 60 guests, which totals $3,900. Please include a standard cancellation policy of 14 days in your agreement. I will also need confirmation on the setup timing and whether you will provide all necessary equipment for the event.  

Looking forward to receiving the contract!
